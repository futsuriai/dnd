## 1 · Arrival at Hýrda

After weeks on the road—and a deadly encounter with a disguised bounty hunter—the party crested the final hill and found themselves at the edge of **Hýrda**, Meri's hometown. Gentle hills rolled beneath high mountains Ysidor called **Hýrda's Embrace** (the Harlurians know them as the Vanguards of Light, named for the goddess Nýtes crossing into mortal form through Hieroterra). The village was home to close to a thousand stone goliaths: simple stone buildings with thatched roofs, communal in design, nestled against the mountainside. To the east, near the local mines, sat an **encampment of roughly twenty ducal army soldiers**—not blocking the village, but positioned with unmistakable intent.

**Meri's Briefing:** The ducal army had arrived **three to four weeks** prior. Their commander had approached; Meri told him exactly where he could go. No aggressive movement yet, but she suspected they were waiting for **reinforcements**. The Duke's goal: exploit the mines and build a mining town, displacing the village. Meri and **Ardwin** (the village blacksmith) had been quietly sharpening plows and forging whatever metal they could into defensive tools. The stone goliaths only used the mines as needed—never for exploitation.

*"We've been here as long as the mountains have. We're not moving."*

Ysidor matched her: *"We're as tough as the mountains. We're not moving at all."* Meri punctuated this with a back-pat that knocked the wind out of him.

When Ysidor immediately pivoted to *"So when are we mounting this attack?"* Meri tempered him: *"Oh, Little Hill, you're a little eager on the violence. As Hyr teaches… violence is only in self-defense."* She was taking her role as chieftess seriously—more measured than her naturally free-spirited demeanor would suggest—and directed the party to Ysidor's house for lodging.

---

## 2 · Ysidor's Grand Castle

The village buildings were communal, open-plan stone structures—no rooms, no privacy. Ysidor's house was tiny: maybe four stone goliaths could fit.

Ysidor, dusting off the single table: *"Welcome to my grand castle. We'll be having food here. There's also the bedroom. That's the kitchen—it's also where I relax. I pretty much do everything here in this one room."*

Berridin had expected something… stonier: *"I thought you guys would have more stone. Like stone furniture."*

*"The walls are stone. The floor is stone. I'm stone. Is that not enough stone for you?"* A beat. *"Well, stone furniture would not be very comfortable."*

Ellara found it familiar despite its differences from where she grew up. Ysidor motioned them toward the "bedroom"—the exact same area they were standing in. Nyx put his stuff down in a corner and immediately took a nap.

Ysidor, surveying his guests: *"Children."*

Whitaker asked about an inn. Ysidor explained guests just slept in someone's house—they didn't get many travelers. A pause. *"We do have a river."*

Nyx: *"You can sleep in the river. That's what I thought you meant."*

Ysidor: *"I've done that before."*

Ellara asked about the average overnight temperature. Whitaker noted there weren't even any trees to hang a hammock. Late summer in the foothills meant cool evenings and cold mountain nights—not ideal river-sleeping weather.

## 3 · Domestic Life in Hýrda

Whitaker immediately asked about a bathhouse, sauna, and masseuses. Hýrda had none. Meri cracked her knuckles with a resonant pop: *"I mean, I could give you a massage."*

Ysidor warned that Whitaker was *"a bit too scrawny"* for Meri's brand of massage. Nyx flatly predicted *"He would die"* and added he *"won't have a head when she's done."* Ysidor shivered—a veteran of Meri's ministrations.

Whitaker persisted about his neck kink, so Meri promised to return with food and "see about your friend's massage." Ysidor, with a resigned sigh: *"Good luck, Number Seven."*

**Family & Culture:**
Berridin's curiosity about Ysidor's family revealed the communal goliath kinship system—Meri was "one of my moms, and also my mentor," his neighbor was also his sister through a shared mother, and *"my dad could be any one of the men in this village. I know who my mom is. But I also don't have a mom, but I have all the moms. Does that make sense?"*

Berridin: *"That did not make sense, but I'm so intrigued."* Nyx kept his mouth shut.

The house itself had been moved stone by stone after a river flood—*"Technically, this isn't my home, but it is my home, because it's the same stones."* The village's elder women all served as communal mothers—some hunted, some worked the mines. *"We had one who was a great seamstress. Didn't sew much, but when she did sew, it was really good."*

At 25, Ysidor was roughly equivalent to a human 17—too young for fatherhood by goliath standards (*"usually the dads are about twice my age"*).

---

## 4 · Meri's Massage & Dinner

Meri returned carrying bundles of tubular vegetables and cured meat. Ysidor pleaded with her to be gentle—*"the humans aren't as tough as us"*—but Meri waved him off: she'd met humans before, she knew they were *"a little bit more frail."* Berridin wasn't hiding his jealousy about the massage arrangement.

**The Massage:**
Whitaker swan-dived onto the bed, clothes flying. Meri—eight feet tall, towering over the naked form—didn't blink. She found the knot and applied pure goliath force to flatten it. Whitaker blacked out.

*"Little Hill, your friend—I think he passed out."*

Ysidor performed a quiet Lay on Hands, calling it *"some of the human magic I learned in the city."* The kink was completely gone. Whitaker came to singing Meri's praises: *"You're a miracle worker. You have magic fingers."*

Meri turned to Ysidor: *"Little Hill—there's no human magic. You've always been doing this. I taught you how to do that."*

**The Stew:**
Meri asked if Ysidor had even started the fire. He grabbed two rocks: *"See, Berridin—there are stones in this village."* Flicked them together. Failed. Pulled out a match: *"Actually, we have technology."*

Meri prepared a hearty late-summer stew from the open shelving—no cupboards, everything exposed. Ysidor, defensively: *"It's… open concept."*

The food was very salty and mineral-rich. Nyx was just happy to eat. Then Whitaker asked for hot sauce—Nyx gave him a death glare—and nudged Berridin: *"Your types carry hot sauce, right?"*

Meri produced a glass container: *"It's not that spicy."* She put a tablespoon on her own food. Whitaker matched her.

**Con save 19:** The spiciest thing he'd ever tasted, but years of poor decisions had built tolerance. He stopped talking entirely, making inarticulate gestures while still eating. Meri was bemused: *"I guess you just don't have a goliath constitution."*

Ysidor added hot sauce: *"It sort of numbs the tongue after a while."* Ellara asked to try—put a big spoonful before Ysidor could warn her to go light. Nyx tried it too (**Con 12**), suffering in silence with a tear rolling down his face, hood pulled up. Berridin cast Elementalism, conjuring buckets of water to dump on his own head, burning through spell slots fighting the pepper.

Whitaker, face nearly as purple as his shirt: *"Really clears the sinuses."*

Ellara, stone-faced: *"This isn't so bad actually. This is pretty good."*

## 5 · The Warning

Over stew, Meri told Ysidor he didn't have to come all this way—*"we'll handle it."* Ysidor pushed back: they'd seen things in the city that weren't human or even living, things she couldn't handle alone, things bigger than him that he couldn't even push.

Meri: *"Well, you're a little hill, after all."*

Ysidor: *"Yeah, but these were bigger than a hill."*

Nyx chose his words carefully—acknowledged Meri's power, then warned her about the warforged: dozens in storage at the lighthouse, ready for deployment. *"These machines can kill you. I choose my words very carefully."* When he mentioned "tens of dozens," Meri deadpanned: *"Nyx, I do know how to count."* Nyx: *"I was looking at Ysidor when I said that."*

The party described fighting three warforged and nearly dying despite having the element of surprise. Ysidor's hit to one's head did zero damage—*"like, offended."* Meri absorbed this soberly: if three nearly killed five of them, exactly what was their plan?

Ysidor: *"Well, I was sort of hoping you would have a plan?"*

**The Bounty:**
Nyx revealed his profession—bounty hunter, sometimes assassin—and a contract on Meri's life from a secret high-profile board. The wording was "taken care of," not killed outright.

Meri: *"Let's be honest—'taking care of' means my head on a platter."*

She asked about the baby ruse: *"Oh, you fell for the old traveling-woman-with-her-baby trick, didn't you?"*

Ysidor: *"We still haven't found the baby."* Whitaker: *"It was a cute baby."*

Meri was pragmatic about assassins—solitary creatures who wouldn't split money—but more concerned with the price: *"I'd be insulted otherwise. If I'm getting this Duke's underwear in a wad, I really hope it's a good price."*

The trail would weed out the weak hunters. The warforged were the real threat. *"I guess they'll find out why we're stone goliaths and this mountain is our home. Hýrda's Embrace is loving, but she is also the one that embraces us at the end of time, too."*

**Meri's Departure:**
She rose to leave, promising to bother Ardwin in the morning, and invited Ysidor to dawn sparring: *"Gotta make sure you didn't grow a little weak in the city."* She was already out the door before he could finish promising he'd kept up practice.

## 6 · Ellara's Crisis

After Meri left, Ellara found a spot at the edge of the room, away from the others—half-praying, half-pleading to her spirit, overwhelmed by the bounty hunter's death. Whitaker (**Perception 17**) noticed first and nudged Nyx: *"Maybe you could say something?"*

Nyx—still recovering from the hot sauce, snot everywhere, not his finest moment—cleared his face and sat beside her.

Ellara, sharply: *"I have seen dead bodies before."* Then, quieter: *"But maybe not one killed in front of me."*

Nyx's response was unexpectedly tender—and visibly surprised him as the words came: *"That's normal. That's a good thing. It means you're a good person."* When she protested that nobody else seemed affected, he was honest: the bad news was she'd see more of it. All of them had been living it—some through profession, some through a bad hand at life. She'd been fortunate to grow up where she didn't have to.

*"We're here for you."* He hadn't said something like that in a long time.

He told her she'd one day face a choice—her life or someone else's—and that her life would change after this. *"I'm kind of just telling you what it is. Trying to help, but I don't know if I'm doing a good job."* He patted her shoulder and went back to his corner.

Ellara, very quietly: *"Thank you."*

Whitaker, from the darkness: *"I remember the first person I saw die. Stable boy got kicked by a horse right in the face. Blood everywhere."*

Nyx: *"Hey, what?"* Ysidor: *"No—it's not the time."*

Nyx, after the interruption settled: *"Look, you're a part of this team. We need everyone. I can't say we won't let anything happen to you, but we'll do our damnedest."*

Ellara: *"I had seen people die in front of me, but that was just the Light reclaiming them. This was different. I know there have been many diatribes about when it's justified to kill, but it's very different seeing it on a page than seeing it in front of you. I will just need to pray on this."*

---

## 7 · Dawn in Hýrda

Ellara's prayers that night brought no dreams—only darkness and silence. The voice did not visit. Perhaps not visiting was also a sign.

**Morning:** Ysidor woke before dawn and found Meri already at the training ground. Ellara rose for dawn prayers at a hillside overlook facing east. Nyx finished his 4-hour trance, then nudged Berridin to go wake Whitaker—who was dead to the world until Berridin conjured a cartoonish bouncing alarm clock (Minor Illusion) next to his head.

**Meri's Training:** She put Ysidor through a rocky montage of drills, wielding a wooden stick against his fully sharpened weapon, unconcerned. He was stronger than before—leveled up and road-hardened. Just as he was about to land a solid hit, she tripped him and pinned him with the pole to his chest.

*"Huh. A little bit better, Little Hill."*

## 8 · Berridin & Ellara – Morning Confessions

Berridin intercepted Ellara as she returned from prayers. He admitted the assassin's death had been weighing on him too—*"that was also my first kill. Does it make me a bad person?"*

Ellara: *"No one but the Light can see all the paths that could have been taken. As much as it pains me to say it, I would still want to live, and she was not going to give us that option."*

Berridin opened up further: *"It's so finite. It's such a final thing to experience."* He told her what the others didn't know—he'd lost his entire family as a child, lost his village, fled to the enclave he'd never truly belonged to. The killing blow had been both satisfying and terrifying.

Ellara was genuinely surprised by the depth: *"Master Berridin, this level of introspection was not something I expected. It is comforting to know you are more than somebody who makes light of all situations."* She confessed that when nobody else seemed affected, she'd wondered if something was wrong with her. *"It is comforting to know I was not alone."*

Berridin pivoted to Eduard: *"I know I come across as aloof and flamboyant and a little bit reckless, but I'm still trying to look out for your best interests. I don't think he would be as introspective when it comes to using people."*

Ellara stared into his eyes for an uncomfortably long time, then slightly smiled.

*"I will take your words into account. It is just—this is the only life I have known, and if I believe you, I do not know what would become of me. But I think your warning… I will think upon it more deeply than I had before."*

Berridin extended his arm and cast Prestidigitation, creating a path of rose petals toward the house.

Ellara: *"Baby steps, I suppose."*

## 9 · Council of War

With everyone assembled—Whitaker eating cold stew straight from the pot—Meri brought Ysidor to see **Ardwin** at his forge. The eight-foot-tall blacksmith greeted them warmly and Meri briefed him on the warforged threat: beings that weren't living, moving on their own, and her concern that force alone wouldn't win this.

Ysidor's introductions were characteristically blunt: *"There's Berridin—he's still a growing boy. There's Nyx, who's… Nyx. There's Ellara, who's very nice. And then there's Whitaker, who's also with us."*

**Berridin's Briefing:**
Berridin cast Disguise Self (lab coat and spectacles), conjured a Minor Illusion whiteboard and a life-size warforged replica, and delivered a tactical presentation. Ardwin, to Meri: *"Do these little ones always do these fancy tricks?"*

Ardwin's tactical mind went to work immediately—weight compensation, power source requirements, mobility constraints. Berridin confirmed they ran on light crystals, then explained the darker truth: the lighthouse had been turning **shadowed goliaths into light crystals** to power the latest models.

Ardwin: *"So the transferring… this is fucked up."*

He pressed for numbers. Nyx described the warforged vault at the lighthouse—rows of dormant units, too many to count. A head-on fight was suicide.

Ysidor: *"Why don't we just face them head on?"*

Nyx: *"Because we'll all be killed."*

Ysidor: *"Well, we didn't have Meri before."*

Nyx: *"Okay. We'll live a couple minutes longer, and then we'll be killed."*

Meri agreed—she could handle two or three, but there's no demoralizing a machine. Whitaker suggested using water against the metal constructs. Nyx actually laughed.

Berridin: *"I don't think I've ever heard Nyx laugh before."*

---

## 10 · The Mine Plan

Meri laid out the dilemma: the Duke wanted the mines, but destroying them would also hurt the village. Her people could field a few hundred fighters, but they weren't fully trained. Whitaker proposed the strategy that stuck—lure the enemy into the mines, then collapse the tunnels on top of them. Nyx was visibly shocked that Whitaker produced a competent idea after the water suggestion.

Whitaker: *"I like blowing things up."*

He elaborated: Berridin could disguise himself as Meri to draw everyone deep inside, then escape. Berridin called it *"almost a suicide mission."* Ysidor: *"I think we can do it."* Meri liked the general idea but thought the biggest problem was sufficient bait. She explained they could sneak in mining supplies first and rebuild later if the destruction drove the Duke away.

**The Plan:**

1. **Steal gunpowder** from the ducal encampment (the village has none; Whitaker would need nitrogen-rich fertilizer and gunpowder to make bombs, or steal dynamite from the mine itself—though he clarified he was *"more of an idea guy for the execution part"*)
2. **Escort miners** to extract critical supplies before destruction
3. **Plant explosives** at key structural points
4. **Lure soldiers** (and eventually warforged reinforcements) deep inside
5. **Collapse everything** on top of them

Whitaker suggested a dry run: lure the current 20 soldiers into the mines first, trap them deep inside, then use them as bait for the warforged main force. Nyx cautioned they couldn't depend on keeping anyone contained—speed was the critical factor. Berridin suggested knockout gas; Whitaker thought he could make some with the right supplies. Forward scouts with sending stones would coordinate timing. Ysidor knew the mines well but couldn't stealth to save his life. Meri asked for the party's help—her people weren't nimble enough for this work.

The village was communal, but the Duke claimed mine ownership under imperial law—a technicality the goliaths didn't recognize.

Whitaker volunteered for the gunpowder theft: *"If you act like you belong, people just think you belong. That's really the key to anything."*

Ellara raised the fallback question—if it all failed, could Meri's people survive in the mountains?

Meri: *"Our people can survive in far worse than this. We came from the mountains; we can stay in the mountains. But no lord sitting in some city is going to tell us—who have lived here far longer—what we can or cannot do."*

Whitaker: *"Respectable. Although if there was an army at my estate's door, I would probably go join another estate."* He mentioned having about two weeks until his first loan payment was due.

Meri, surveying the party: *"Little Hill, you have some clever friends, don't you?"*

Ysidor: *"Yeah, they're great."*

Whitaker: *"You're not too bad yourself."*

Ysidor: *"Thank you, Number Eight."*

Ysidor: *"You know I was never good with numbers."*

## Where We Stand

| Thread | Status |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Meri & the Ducal Army** | ~20 soldiers camped east of the village near the mines; reinforcements (including warforged) expected within two weeks. Meri refuses to yield the village. |
| **The Mine Plan** | Lure enemies into the mines and collapse them. Requires: stolen gunpowder, planted explosives, extracted mining supplies, convincing bait, and precise timing. |
| **Bounty on Meri** | Active contract from a high-profile assassination board. One hunter already killed en route; more expected. Meri is unconcerned about assassins, worried about warforged. |
| **Ellara's Faith** | Shaken by witnessing her first killing; found comfort in Nyx's candor and Berridin's surprising vulnerability. Beginning to take warnings about Eduard more seriously. |
| **Berridin's Growth** | Admitted the assassin kill was his first; opened up about family loss and the enclave he never belonged to. Deepening bond with Ellara. |
| **Whitaker's Loan** | 1,000g debt with ~two weeks until first payment; estate at risk if unpaid. |

## Next Steps

1. **Steal gunpowder** from the ducal encampment—Whitaker has volunteered
2. **Escort miners** to extract critical supplies before the mines are destroyed
3. **Plant explosives** and prepare the trap
4. **Decide on bait**—Berridin disguised as Meri, or another gambit to lure troops deep inside
5. **Coordinate timing** with sending stones and forward scouts before reinforcements arrive

## 1) Courtesies & Titles – Ellara, Proctor Eduard, and Director Reeves

Picking up from the mess hall, Ellara found herself in the company of Proctor Eduard and a lanky man with intentional bed-hair and a well-tailored suit: Donnathan Reeves.

**Reeves:** "Oh, it's a pleasure to meet you. What brings you?"

**Ellara:** (explaining her presence)

**Reeves:** "Oh, Eduard is an old friend. I met his niece, **Empress Consort Lyssandra**, in Pharos…"

He continued, "I like to say I handle **public relations** for the Duskbreaker Lighthouse. I act as liaison between the imperial family, nobility, and the Eulogians, and I've worked closely with Eduard as he sees the benefit of the technology we're developing."

Ellara's mind raced, a sudden flash of memory connecting the dots (**History Nat 20**): She knew Proctor Eduard was the **fifth son** of a large, middle-ranking noble family—the **previous Marchioness of Marchenbau**, from the imperial province of Boixden. His eldest brother inherited, and it was his grand-niece (not niece) who had married into the imperial family, becoming the Empress Consort. She had looked up the genealogy once; she knew he came from a very powerful family.

**Reeves:** "I just wanted to stop by to thank Eduard before stopping to see His Grace (the Duke)."

**Ellara:** "Proctor Eduard, coming from such a distinguished family, I do hope I have not offended you."

**Proctor:** "My mother put me here, and I find fulfillment in putting the light into the next generation. Director Reeves is good at socializing."

**Ellara:** "I would never be able to either. My tongue would get me in trouble around such distinguished people."

**Reeves:** "Being a second child myself, I had all the tutors in the world, and Torchlight College. My parents sent me there, that's where I met Valeria—I meant, His Grace."

He smiled. "My family has been known for our wines; my brother is the **Count of Sommeil**."

**Eduard:** "Oh yes, yes, Director Reeves. Or should I say **Viscount Donnathan**."

**Reeves:** "Now, now, you know how much I hate my title outside court."

Ellara tried an awkward half-bow.

**Reeves:** "I prefer not to sit on titles, useless around most folks outside of courts…"

He glanced at Ellara. "In the future, it seems it might help: for Marquis and below, it would be Lord, Lady, or Lux. Lord Reeves or **Lord Sommeil**. Alternatively, Viscount Reeves."

**Ellara:** (Waving it away) "I don't think I'll be talking to such important people."

**Reeves:** "I'm sure you weren't expecting this. I haven't seen **Valerian** in a while. And I really do need to give my greetings."

As Reeves mentioned the name "Valerian," Ellara caught Proctor Eduard's face squish in a small, unreadable reaction; it was a *very* informal way to refer to the Grand Duke (**Insight 12**).

## 2) The Office of Light – Trust, Doubt, and Doctrine

After Reeves left, Ellara asked to speak with the Proctor privately. He led her to his office, a room of organized piles of papers, neat shelving, and a glowing **light-crystal lamp** on the desk.

**Ellara:** "Were you able to bring up the issue of the **goliath** with Director Reeves?"

**Eduard:** "Yes, yes. Donnathan said he'd look into it. He doesn't necessarily deal with it day-to-day and just came back. He will go to the ducal palace for a few days, as he's wont to do. It'll take time."

**Ellara:** "I got worried you were not who you seemed… but I'm glad you are who you seemed."

She mentioned the Denmother and her scrolls full of intrigue.

**Eduard:** "I do not make my **birth** public, but I am the **Proctor** now. It is part of the light to question. That is the path of the light. And again, the Denmother—we are all allowed our own little indulgences. These processes take long; the nobility takes long. This is why I was not born for these. I am much happier here."

**Ellara:** "The path of the light may not be simple, but at least it's more **straightforward**."

**Eduard:** "It is much **harder** if you have not been born into it. They were *born* doing that."

**Ellara:** "Oh, perhaps that's why the path is easy for me. But I have met some people not born into the path and have struggled to have my words reach them."

**Eduard:** "While we can **light** a room, they must **choose** it. They must take that first step. Continue doing what you are. However, sometimes you find success in those that choose."

**Ellara:** "D-do you trust Director Reeves?"

**Eduard:** "To be frank, he is a man **bound by ambition** and his **own loyalties**. I trust him to do what **he** will, always."

## 3) Stones Across the City – Check-ins and Friction

At **Nyx's** apartment, **Berridin** was napping, "with memories of Meri". Nyx took out a **sending stone**.

> **Nyx:** "Checking in. Done with Eduard?"

> **Ellara:** "Yes. I was able to talk to Proctor Eduard. Fantastic news! He is who he said he was and we can trust him."

> **Nyx:** "Any other details?"

> **Ellara:** "O-oh, he was talking to Director Reeves. It might just take a while to get details."

> **Nyx:** "Thanks, good job. Are you safe?"

> **Ellara:** "Of course I'm safe. The **Seminary** is a safe place."

Nyx turned to his empty room. "Any other questions for her?" he muttered to himself, before pressing the stone again.

> **Nyx:** "In terms of next steps, what should we do?"

> **Ellara:** "He's following up on it. It may just take time."

> **Nyx:** "We could be waiting 2-3 years."

> **Ellara:** "I'm sure it would not be 2 years. He would have mentioned if it would take that long."

> **Nyx:** "Alright, so what do we do?"

Berridin, waking up, overheard Nyx's side of the conversation. "How's Ellara?" he asked. "Did she realize her mentor is a **crazy person**?"

Ellara, hearing Berridin's comment over the still-active stone, went silent.

> **Ellara:** "Master Berridin, with all due respect, perhaps you need to talk to Nyx. I will talk to you all tomorrow."

She put her stone away.

Berridin, realizing his error, immediately reached out again (**Persuasion 21**).

> **Ellara:** (Curtly) "Yes."

> **Berridin:** "I just want to apologize. When I wake up, I say things that can be taken out of turn."

> **Ellara:** (Sighs) "I appreciate you reaching out to me. I accept your apology."

> **Berridin:** "We're trying to decide our next steps… maybe we should tail Donnathan."

> **Ellara:** "Oh yes, I did learn he's a **viscount** and he was going to visit the **Grand Duke for a few days**."

> **Berridin:** "How do you want to split? …Unfortunately, I think Nyx is still the best to tail people."

> **Ellara:** "Are you talking about tailing Director Reeves into the **Grand Duke's palace**??"

Nyx, overhearing, made frantic cut-off motions.

> **Nyx:** (Over the stone) "We don't want what happened to Meri to continue. We need information."

> **Ellara:** "Yes, I know. Because tailing someone into the Grand Palace is **not the same** as tailing them into a **dark alley and killing them**."

Nyx did an insight check on Reeves (**Insight 12**); he'd heard rumors that Reeves does indeed spend a lot of time in the ducal palace when he's in the city.

> **Nyx:** "Thanks, Ellara. What are you going to do? …Let's not lose sight of what we're trying to achieve. We saw what happened to Meri. It was Meri now, it could be other Shadowed later. We want to stop that."

> **Ellara:** "Have a blessed evening."

## 4) The Lamp that Screamed – Vision, Temptation, and a Test

That night, Ellara prayed for guidance (**Religion 18**). A comfort and calmness came to her, but no immediate answer. It was enough to help her sleep.

In her sleep, however, she heard voices in agony, calling out for help. All she could see was an image of the **little light-crystal lamp on a desk… and it was screaming at her**. It was the lamp from the Proctor's office.

The next morning, she reflected (**Insight 16**): light crystals are formed by the remains of the Shadowed. Perhaps she had felt their pain.

She did her morning prayers and then went to his office. She tried the door. It opened. She went in and tried to take the light crystal from the lamp.

(**Sleight of Hand 8**) She reached a point where she could take it, but it would cause damage.

(**Guidance +3**) She tried again, carefully, trying to leave the lamp in the exact same position.

Just then, the Proctor arrived. "Oh, Ellara."

**Ellara:** "I had a **vision** about your lamp. I was wondering if I could take it for a…"

**Proctor:** "Tell me more about your vision."

She told him about the screaming.

**Proctor:** "In my years of experience, sometimes there are messages from Eulogia, sometimes they tell us about our stresses and **anxieties**. You're welcome to borrow it. But this is the **wrong path** to examine it. Maybe your dream is that frustration."

**Ellara:** "Perhaps that is a metaphor, but it would help me sleep better knowing I have that symbol of the light."

**Proctor:** "Just please return it shortly. It's better at illuminating my office at night."

Back in her room, she examined the crystal (**Investigation 16**; **Arcana 16**). She figured out the mechanism and took out the crystal itself. It was a light crystal lamp. A light crystal, same as any other. She realized, with dawning horror, that perhaps the vision was not about *this* light crystal, but about the **pain they all represent**.

## 5) Masks On – The Return to the Lighthouse

At Nyx's household, the tension was palpable.

**Berridin** was idly flipping two knives.

**Ysidor:** "We went over this. Only flip one knife at a time."

**Berridin:** "I'm going through something!"

As Berridin juggled, Nyx's hand shot out, grabbing one dagger mid-air before it hit the ceiling.

**Nyx:** "Please don't—the molding is expensive."

Berridin tried to cover a little etching he'd been carving into the wall, but Nyx noticed.

**Nyx:** "Where do we hit first for recon?"

**Ysidor:** "The Lighthouse. Maybe break some things."

**Nyx:** "Berridin… Before we go back to the Lighthouse, let's recap what went well and what didn't. We have to be careful. Even in a disguise, it depends on what the disguise is."

They decided on new disguises:
* **Ysidor:** "Moose".
* **Nyx:** "Noctis," with long, Aragorn-like hair.
* **Berridin:** "Kal'din Veilspire," a 6-foot tall, ebony-skinned, gruff soldier with a scar across his cheek.

**Nyx:** (To Berridin) "You know you can never use this persona again, right? This is why I don't spend too long on it."

They approached the Lighthouse.

**Noctis:** "We have these stones (the rune passes) but it'll trigger the system. And she's been missing… the guard might be in already as well."

Ysidor (Moose) threw a rock at a warforged. An echoing sound. He threw another rock, with angrier emotions.

(**Unarmed Attack Roll: 22**) It hit. The warforged rumbled, lights turned on, and it unfolded from 5 feet to 8 feet tall, looking right at him. A guard ran out.

**Guard:** "What in the Shadowed Monarch is going on here?"

**Moose:** (Pointing at the warforged) "He started it."

(**Deception: Dirty 20**)

**Guard:** (Incredulous)

**Moose:** "These machines… clearly defective."

The guard sighed, went to the machine, and powered it down before going back inside.

**Berridin:** "Let's try again, and Nyx, you sneak in during the confusion."

Moose stood between the two warforged and cast **Word of Radiance**. They saved, taking no damage. Initiative was rolled.

## 6) Bullet-Time – The Scramble at the Gate

The forecourt erupted into chaos:

* A **guard captain** dashed out, arriving right beside Ysidor.

* **Berridin** (as Kal'din) looked scared and tried to shove the warforged, acting as if it had attacked his friend. The construct switched its eyes to him. (**Performance bonus action: Nat 1**). The guard captain immediately became suspicious of him.

* A second **guard** dashed out.

* **Nyx** (Noctis) tried to sneak in (**Stealth 16**). He got past the guards but used his pass at the gate. **Alarms went off**. He tried to play it off (**Deception w/ disadvantage: 5**). No one bought it.

* A **warforged** attacked Berridin (**14 to hit**), dealing **13 points of damage**.

* The other **warforged** attacked Ysidor (**18 to hit**), dealing **4 damage**.

* **Ysidor** grabbed Berridin and bolted, provoking opportunity attacks (**10, 13, 16, 8—all missed**). He used **Lay on Hands** to fully heal Berridin for **13 points**, then cast **Shield of Faith** (+2 AC).

* The **guard captain** chased Ysidor and attacked. (**12, miss**). (**Nat 20**). The attack dealt **17 damage**, which Ysidor reduced to **13** using **Stone's Resistance**.

* **Berridin**, slung over Ysidor's shoulder, created a **Minor Illusion** of a wall and gave Ysidor **Bardic Inspiration**.

* The **guard** was confused by the wall.

* **Nyx**, inside, attacked a guard (**18 to hit, 5 damage**) and then dashed out in a different direction.

* A **warforged** turned and moved inside, coming toward Nyx's last known position (**7, miss; 12, miss**).

* The other **warforged** went up to the illusionary wall.

* **Ysidor** disengaged and ran.

* **Berridin** created a **Minor Illusion** of Nyx next to him and gave Nyx **Bardic Inspiration**.

* A **warforged** attacked the illusion of Nyx, then ran to the door.

* The second **warforged** turned back to Ysidor and attacked (**Nat 20**). Berridin used **Silvery Barbs**, forcing a reroll (**12**), which missed.

* **Four more guards and warforged** appeared at the Lighthouse door.

* The **guard captain** dashed but couldn't reach Ysidor.

* **Berridin** cast a **Minor Illusion** sound: "Captain! Another intrusion into the building!" He then cast **Mirror Image** on Ysidor.

* The **guard** finally figured out the illusionary wall and headed toward Nyx.

* **Nyx** dashed and tried to hide (**Stealth 10**). He used his Bardic Inspiration die (**a 2**), bringing his total to **12**.

* A **warforged** threw a javelin at Ysidor (**20 to hit, 19 damage**). A **Mirror Image** took the hit, but the damage still went through (**11 points**). A second javelin (**24 to hit**) was fully prevented by another **Mirror Image**.

* **Ysidor** dashed, parkoured up onto a roof, and was out of combat.

* **Nyx**, seeing Ysidor get away, used **Blessing of the Raven Queen** to teleport to the same roof, then dashed and hid (**Stealth 19**). He was out of combat.

## 7) Badwater and Boundaries – The Aftermath on the Stones

The group was scattered. Nyx used his sending stone.

> **Nyx:** "Hey, I'm good. Are you guys good?"

> **Berridin:** "We're freaking out! Are you ok?"

Nyx considered where to meet (**Insight 23**). He didn't want a big landmark; he needed an obscure place in East Bastion.

> **Nyx:** "I'll find you. Meet me at **Badwater Well** in **one day's** time."

---

Later, Ellara, unaware of the chaos, reached out to Nyx.

> **Ellara:** "Sorry for not reaching out earlier. I think we do need to do something about the light crystal and the evils they bring… Should I go to Nyx's—"

> **Nyx:** "**NO.** Now is not a good time. Give us **two days**. We'll call you. Maybe don't go near the Lighthouse."

> **Ellara:** "Did something happen?"

> **Nyx:** (In a serious voice) "Everything is fine. Have your sending stone on you."

Unsettled, Ellara contacted Berridin.

> **Ellara:** "Master Berridin, is everything ok? Nyx sounds very stressed."

> **Berridin:** "Ellara, I've been thinking a lot about this whole job thing. How did you get into this whole acolyte thing? What drives you?"

> **Ellara:** "Fantastic, though I do not know if you want to follow my path. I was raised in the priory, not knowing my parents."

> **Berridin:** "I find myself in unsavoury situations…"

> **Ellara:** "That would be lovely. The light is there for those that seek it."

> **Berridin:** "We've just been discussing our plan of action, so we'll figure it out."

> **Ellara:** "O-ok. But I can't shake the feeling something is wrong. Master Nyx forgot to speak in his **condescending voice**."

> **Berridin:** "We made a bet."

> **Ellara:** "A bet?"

> **Berridin:** "Ysidor and Nyx were arguing about something mundane. Definitely not doing things without you."

Ellara sensed the lie (**Insight 21 vs. Deception 18**).

> **Ellara:** "If I may… if you do wish to find the light, then the first step is to be **honest**. I will speak to you tomorrow."

## 8) Threads, Tensions, and Next Steps

**Resolved / Advanced**
* **Proctor Eduard's origins & ties**: Confirmed nobility of **Marchenbau**; personal connection (via grand-niece) to the Imperial family. He presents as sincere in his doctrine but pragmatic about courtly matters and his family's influence.
* **Reeves' status**: Confirmed **Viscount** ("Lord Sommeil"), liaison to nobility, and close acquaintance of the Grand Duke ("Valerian"). He is splitting time between Bastion & the **Ducal Palace**; his ambition is acknowledged by Eduard.
* **Ellara's Lamp Vision**: Her vision was a **moral realization** about the suffering inherent in *all* light crystals, not a curse on the specific object.

**Complications**
* **Security posture** at the Lighthouse is **hair-trigger**. The party's rune passes are now compromised, as their **use is logged** and tied to the alarm. The **constructs** escalate violently and immediately when provoked.
* **Public heat** is rising after the gate incident. The party is scattered, with a rendezvous at **Badwater Well** set for **one day**; Ellara has been told to wait **two days**.
* **Internal trust** is frayed. Ellara knows Berridin is lying to her, and her "dark alley" comment to Nyx shows lingering tension over his past actions.

**Open Questions**
1) What leverage—if any—does **Eduard** have over **Reeves**?
2) Can **Reeves** be tailed at the **Ducal Palace** without catastrophic risk?
3) Does Ellara confront **Eduard** about the **screaming lamp** truth—and the **theology** it implies?
4) How can the party re-enter the Lighthouse now that their **passes are hot**?

**Next Session Hooks**
* **Badwater Well meet-up**.
* **Reeves** itinerary intel via palace servants or vintners' guild contacts.
* **Non-lethal kits** & cleaner **exfil** plans (mirror image & illusions worked; bolster with smoke/grease/cover stories).
* **Ellara ↔ Berridin**: truth-telling and trust, or the party's **ethics line** snaps.

**Body Count (Bastion's Ledger):** *None* this session.

**Moral Equilibrium:** strained but intact.

**Operational Assets:** existing (but compromised) rune passes; sending stones; field-tested illusions and escapes; growing political picture.`;export{e as default};

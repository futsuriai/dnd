const e=`## Session 1: The Adventure Begins

**Date:** Year 651 AE (After Eulogia)
**Location:** Bastion City, Hieroterra Province, Hariolar Empire

**Opening Scene: A City Divided, A Day of Alms**
The session opens in the year 651 AE (After Eulogia) in Bastion City, the gleaming capital of Hieroterra, an eastern province of the Hariolar Empire. Hieroterra, ruled by Duke Valerian Oliander, is considered a somewhat backwater region where the Eulogia's influence is less potent, and a significant "shadowed" population resides. Bastion City itself is bisected by a canal, creating a stark East-West divide. The West is opulent, home to the ducal palace, a grand Eulogian edifice, and aristocratic residences. In contrast, the East, while featuring the innovative Duskbreaker Lighthouse—a research center for light crystals whose early lamp inventions illuminate its main streets—is generally more modest and utilitarian. Here, roads are less paved, homes simpler, especially further from the lighthouse, and it serves as a gateway to the province's more untamed areas.

Today is a bright day, a day of Alms Giving. Members of the Eulogian faith are distributing food and necessities, an event open to all, though the offerings in the West might be more luxurious compared to the modest fare in the East.

**Arrivals and Early Connections: Nyx & Tsi'nyra**
In a five-story, unassuming building in Bastion City, **Nyx**, a dark elf Gloomstalker has darkish skin and crossbow mastery, resides in a somewhat rustic, nature-infused pied-à-terre. He receives a letter, mysteriously delivered, from a dear friend, asking him to help her daughter.

Soon after, **Tsi'nyra**, a "normal" human of East Asian appearance with long black hair and a loyal leopard companion, arrives at Nyx's doorstep. It's her first time in a big city, away from her family which is her purpose. She carries a necklace from her mother and an air of wisdom that belies her unfamiliarity with urban life. Nyx offers her basic amenities. Tsi'nyra confides that her journey was stressful; she feels lost and reveals the true purpose of her visit: her two older siblings are missing, and she needs Nyx's help to find them.

**The Gathering at Alms Giving: Ellara, Berridin & Ysidor**
Meanwhile, on the eastern side of the city, during the Alms Giving outside a church, several other individuals converge.

**Ellara**, a red-haired woman in her twenties with grey eyes and a devout follower of the Eulogian faith, is handing out food. A true believer who grew up in a small-town priory, she's still adjusting to the vastness of Bastion City but is keen to learn about the locals.

**Berridin**, a small halfling with South Asian features and a distinctive radiant gold strip in his hair, navigates the crowd. Known for being quick to a smile despite an inwardly hesitant nature, he's been in the city for a while and knows Alms Giving is a good opportunity for supplies.

Their paths cross when Berridin attempts to palm a loaf of bread, which then falls and hits a foot – the foot of **Ysidor**, a towering 7'6" goliath. Ysidor, with his grey, granite-like skin, a jade pendant, a war pick at his hip, and a pitchfork on his back, is a newcomer to the city. Stunned by the city's light and having given away his money to beggars, he's famished. He loudly asks if someone dropped the bread. Ellara clarifies it wasn't Berridin's, and the bread ends up with Ysidor.

**The Party Unites: A Fateful Encounter**
Nyx and Tsi'nyra, walking through the city, witness this interaction. Tsi'nyra, intrigued by the goliath, asks Nyx about him. Nyx advises caution but friendliness. They approach to get food.

As Ellara gives them bread, Ysidor, spotting Tsi'nyra's leopard, exclaims "Kitty!" and moves to pet it. Nyx intervenes, and Ellara, concerned about the commotion disturbing the alms distribution, ushers the group into a back courtyard. It is here that Ellara feels a sense of destiny, a test from the Eternal Light, believing she is meant to help this disparate group, despite the presence of "Shadowed" individuals among them.

Introductions are made. Berridin, lifted by Ysidor, curiously asks Tsi'nyra about her small stature. Berridin, "the Bold" as he calls himself, might have heard of Nyx. Ysidor, learning Nyx has a reputation in the city, pulls out a crude charcoal drawing of a stick figure, asking if Nyx has seen his missing mentor, Meri.

**The First Clue: The Missing Mentor, Meri**
Berridin recalls rumors of a goliath causing a stir and injuring guards. Ellara, with a flash of insight (a natural 20), remembers seeing a similar, respectful goliath two alms givings ago. She recounts the story of Meri: a ferocious goliath who reportedly took down twenty guards while shouting accusations against the Duskbreaker Lighthouse. Meri was arrested, an incident the clergy dismissed as typical "Shadowed" behavior. Ysidor confirms this sounds like his mentor. Ellara explains that while initially held in an eastern prison, Meri was later moved.

Ysidor wishes to go to the "arrestation station" immediately, but Ellara suggests a more cautious approach, offering to send a message instead, to which Ysidor agrees, trusting her. Housing the massive goliath presents a challenge; Berridin's halfling-sized offer is too cramped, and Nyx claims his place is "under renovations," a lie Berridin catches. The party agrees to reconvene in two days to discuss their next steps. As they part, Ellara and Berridin exchange Eulogian blessings, while Ysidor offers a blessing to "Hyr," prompting Ellara to see an opportunity to guide him to the Eulogian faith.

As the new light crystal lamps begin to illuminate the city, Ysidor is awestruck, wondering if they "plucked stars from the sky," while Tsi'nyra inquires if they've "harnessed bioluminescence." Nyx explains it's new technology from the Duskbreaker Lighthouse. Ellara gives Ysidor leftover food, hoping it brings him "closer to the light," which Ysidor interprets literally, much to Ellara's hopeful excitement.

**Separate Paths, Gathering Threads:**

**Nyx & Tsi'nyra – Plans and Secrets:**
After parting from the main group, Nyx and Tsi'nyra discuss her missing siblings. Tsi'nyra reveals her "bond with kin" hasn't triggered, meaning her siblings are not close, and agents of the Mothertree haven't reported anything. Nyx resolves that they must find more allies and that he will see what he can do. Later, Nyx instructs Tsi'nyra not to reveal where he lives and to keep their information secret. Tsi'nyra, agreeing with "Mum's the word," shows fascination with the local food and unfamiliar amenities like plumbing, her leopard companion also eating.

**Berridin & Ysidor – Halfling Quarter Escapades:**
Berridin leads Ysidor to the halfling residential area, where Ysidor's large stature is particularly noticeable. Concerned about having enough food once the young halflings arrive, Berridin asks Ysidor to eat some of a loaf of bread. Soon, small halfling children appear and begin climbing on Ysidor, eagerly greeting "Uncle Berridin." Amidst playful interactions, including a comment about not giving the children candy (alluding to a past "candy incident of 650"), Berridin assures them it's "all healthy food." To create a diversion and slip away, Berridin asks Ysidor if his people fart. After Ysidor confirms, Berridin casts a minor illusion of a fart cloud, allowing them to escape. He then goes to check on a neighbor, mindful of Ysidor's heavy presence.

**Ellara's Inquiries:**
Ellara visits the Denmother to inquire about the arrested goliath, Meri. The Denmother surmises Meri was likely arrested and could be found in the eastern prisons (unaware yet of the transfer). Ellara requests assistance in gathering information, and the Denmother agrees to try, remarking that it was good of Ellara to be in the city, having come from "outside of the gaze of the light." Ellara affirms her belief that her priory is "within the light." Afterwards, Ellara returns home and writes a letter to a friend from her hometown.

**Nyx Gathers Information:**
Nyx decides to visit a watering hole in a shadier area of the city to seek information. He asks the bartender about his missing folk, but the bartender initially has no news, though he mentions a "young guard captain" with whom "luck hasn't been with him." Nyx requests they keep an ear out. Later, dealt an "abysmal hand" in a card game, Nyx remarks, "Luck is not on my side tonight."

Eventually, someone at the bar mentions their friends have also reported people missing. A nearby guard initially dismisses these concerns. However, when it's emphasized that "this is different," the guard recalls the goliath (Meri) who had gone missing about two months prior. The guard, who wasn't present at the incident, relays a dramatic account: Meri had reportedly "taken out 20" assailants, who were "beat up pretty bad." Meri was initially held in an eastern prison but was then moved to one of the western prisons because the situation was "so weird." At this point, the guard becomes physically ill and abruptly stops talking, leaving Nyx with crucial, if unsettling, new information.

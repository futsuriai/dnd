[00:00:00] GM: oh I was like what the fuck is that I saw the pop up first and I'm like who's Craig
[00:00:01] Ellara: now recording it's okay wait is it evening i thought like when we have left early okay
[00:00:03] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: thanks craig i just want to say that it could get around the world in 80 days so like at maximum we
[00:00:04] Nyx: yeah we're getting hacked don't bring it up again i'm done i'm done with you
[00:00:15] GM: anyways last we left off finding out that Hilda was going to be attacked and
[00:00:22] GM: reaching out to Meri and knowing that there are already soldiers of the Grand
[00:00:27] GM: duke kind of outside the area the party decided to go and gave assistance they
[00:00:36] GM: were trying to figure out what the best way was there seemed to be some admin
[00:00:41] GM: admin wanting to fly however it was determined that it would take a little
[00:00:48] GM: bit too long to get the proper vehicle as it would be custom-made and maybe the
[00:00:55] GM: funds might not be there who knows
[00:00:57] GM: they also discussed Nyx's findings previously about the Black
[00:01:02] GM: Swan and the hit on Meri's life or more more discreetly put to be disposed so
[00:01:13] GM: with that the party decided to kind of go a little bit traditional and you know
[00:01:19] GM: get a wagon and horses kind of putting the airship did original who knows what
[00:01:25] GM: they were thinking on hold for the next few days
[00:01:26] GM: for now one would hope as I recall the party was going to meet up at Whitty's
[00:01:31] Nyx: so it's evening Nyx kind of just says okay so let's all right after that yeah it's the night
[00:01:32] Berridin: It's coming back.
[00:01:33] Berridin: Act two, it's coming back.
[00:01:37] Berridin: I'm down.
[00:01:42] GM: house with the horses as they kind of split up and some went to get the horses
[00:01:49] GM: and I believe also Ellara did have a conversation with Proctor Eduard letting
[00:01:56] GM: letting him know she would be gone by the time the party was ready to go so I
[00:01:58] GM: I am sure he will be on for a while and he gave her full support as well as a
[00:02:05] GM: little book to study while she was gone so kind we're at the Whittiest state the
[00:02:13] GM: Whitaker the Whitman estate as it were I believe everyone has come back you have
[00:02:21] GM: your horses I think you got three horses at the end didn't did a little deal try
[00:02:25] GM: that didn't work didn't get a little deal I'll try to get his
[00:02:27] GM: horse him and let him go in his car but he left in no time it's not that he was
[00:02:28] GM: finder fees uh Nyx may be a little upset uh but yeah so it is evening you have horses carriage
[00:02:42] GM: um it took you a whole day to figure all this out for clarity opened the last session opened
[00:03:02] Ellara: okay surely if you do like a you go in oh wait outside whitaker whitman obviously what's his
[00:03:03] Nyx: before yeah and yeah no that was both in real time and in game time
[00:03:08] GM: in the morning where you had witty kind of wandering the streets Nyx runs into him
[00:03:14] GM: brings witty home you spent a good part of the late morning early afternoon and into the afternoon
[00:03:22] GM: chasing down an airship your personal erica a lot of time was spent on this
[00:03:32] Nyx: i'm a little i'm a little bitter about it i'll be honest
[00:03:36] GM: it was a two-hour quest um
[00:03:41] Nyx: when i found out it didn't have forward propulsion
[00:03:47] Nyx: i'm just led here under false pretenses um yeah so Nyx just kind of was literally i i'm imagining
[00:03:51] GM: honestly you gotta roll with the punch
[00:03:53] GM: is i just remember andres's searches after just sleep over at witty's i guess or uh if you want
[00:04:05] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: would have gotten there like regardless of which direction we went we would have been there within
[00:04:10] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: 80 days so at least we had a good view well is the bank still open will it open in the morning
[00:04:13] Ysidor: in other words we don't serve poor people witty the first oh my god
[00:04:14] Nyx: little side thing i do imagine the scene like if this were animated adventure and we did that we
[00:04:20] Nyx: went through it and we did that and we did that and we did that and we did that and we did that
[00:04:20] Nyx: the hot air balloon and there's a scene where like we're flying over where Meri is supposed
[00:04:24] Nyx: to be and everything's on fire like and all the soldiers there all the automatons are there
[00:04:30] Nyx: the Warforged everything's destroyed and you witty just goes well at least we got the hot air
[00:04:38] Nyx: balloon yeah anyway i digress so Nyx just goes upon you all right look so we're heading out
[00:04:50] Nyx: tomorrow morning let's get there at first light let's leave a first light grab all your stuff
[00:04:59] Nyx: so make sure you have everything before we head out
[00:05:06] Nyx: i think Berridin you should go to the bank with witty that's my way down
[00:05:15] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: before we leave i should probably like before i leave a city see like if i'm able to withdraw
[00:05:20] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: any funds from my family uh account okay yeah yeah i think i mentioned that last time yeah
[00:05:26] GM: we could say before everyone got back you did do that you wanna turn back time for a minute
[00:05:33] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: yeah that'd be great uh yeah i think i was on my own at this point yeah it didn't last me i
[00:05:34] GM: okay so we will um rewind a little who would have been with you just you on your own um
[00:05:47] GM: i think
[00:05:48] GM: quick okay yeah so um after um after a little bit of walking uh you went you come across this ornate
[00:05:50] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: invited him to see if he wanted to come to the bank well actually he probably might want to come
[00:05:54] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: with me if i said i was going to get money good afternoon uh good afternoon ma'am i am uh
[00:06:08] GM: building uh almost um massive columns in the front with a steeple roof all made of stone
[00:06:12] Nyx: oh good i'm not here
[00:06:17] GM: um a very um mix of neoclassical and art uh deco kind of design and as you go in massive doors
[00:06:26] GM: larger than you
[00:06:28] GM: side, you see gorgeous tiles, bronze works, all that. And there's like, kind of further in,
[00:06:38] GM: there's like guards at the door, at least two you can see. And there's kind of a few other people
[00:06:47] GM: there. Kind of, there's a line, and there seems to be one kind of teller of a sort. And yeah,
[00:06:57] GM: after a bit, you're in line, you know, maybe about 10, 20 minutes later, and he goes,
[00:07:06] GM: excuse me, it's your turn to go to the teller. And she goes, well, good afternoon, sir.
[00:07:12] GM: How may I help you? Hold on a moment, I will go and get that ledger. And you see,
[00:07:18] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: of the whitman estate and i need to make a withdrawal from
[00:07:22] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: our
[00:07:22] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: uh
[00:07:22] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: funds what was he he made a withdrawal how of how much okay when was that when was the last
[00:07:28] GM: she steps back in kind of going and she kind of goes to a wall with multiple tomes,
[00:07:35] GM: and you see her mumbling and kind of alphabetically,
[00:07:38] GM: with Haker, she pulls up this massive volume, and she's going through it. And she goes,
[00:07:43] GM: well, I see the last withdrawal was authorized by one Jarvis. He was in your employ.
[00:07:56] GM: Well, there's a history of, there's a history of withdrawals. There has been a withdrawal of
[00:08:05] GM: every week, about 200 gold, about two weeks ago.
[00:08:12] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: withdrawal he made oh about two weeks ago perfect so um can i make uh both last week's withdrawal
[00:08:21] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: and this week's withdrawal so 400 gold well this is this is you know an interesting development
[00:08:26] GM: Wow.
[00:08:28] GM: Here's the thing. It would seem, the withdrawal two weeks ago,
[00:08:36] GM: he depleted the remainder of the funds.
[00:08:44] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: because uh you know jarvis quit uh more than that
[00:08:52] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: ago and uh so this would be fraud um so uh what's what's your bank yeah
[00:08:57] GM: When did he quit? I thought it was two weeks ago.
[00:09:00] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: uh well you know time you know in in in in spirit he quit before he made that withdrawal
[00:09:01] GM: I fucked up.
[00:09:09] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: um whether or not you know you know he had he had physically walked away or not you know he
[00:09:16] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: was planning it so you know i feel like this is fraud is there sort of a you know a fraud division
[00:09:19] GM: Sir, it is unfortunate. However, clients are responsible for accrediting users and giving them
[00:09:21] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: here
[00:09:22] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: uh first first uh have you heard of my father uh lord whitman uh is good for any reimbursement
[00:09:30] GM: the right to withdraw from the accounts.
[00:09:33] GM: We are not liable should you revoke, should you not revoke access to the accounts?
[00:09:40] GM: It is an unfortunate situation. However, there's nothing I can do at the moment,
[00:09:44] GM: as there is no way for us to know that this was a fraudulent activity.
[00:09:48] GM: As per our accounts, he is still allowed to withdraw from your account.
[00:09:55] GM: Okay.
[00:10:09] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: uh for a like forward you know uh that the bank could provide to our account on loan
[00:10:19] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: he's here oh yeah he's he's
[00:10:20] GM: So, should your father be the one to pull out a loan?
[00:10:28] GM: i would need his presence um here um there are many nobles who use their parents names to pull
[00:10:35] GM: out loans and we have seen it in our best practice to ensure that those parental figures are here in
[00:10:42] GM: person to do such withdrawals um so we will gladly give you a loan once your father um appears why
[00:10:51] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: here he's right outside can i go get him uh so i like walk outside and like kind of give din a
[00:10:57] GM: not yeah yeah uh yeah go for it describe well it's a cantrip it's a cantrip so it doesn't even
[00:10:59] Berridin: You want me to turn you into the dad?
[00:11:02] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: little head shake uh to go with me um and then i kind of like before we get aside we kind of like
[00:11:08] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: turn i pull him into the bathroom and uh i ask him if he can like you know like that that suit
[00:11:15] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: he made me if he can make me like a new suit that might make me uh you know look more older yeah

[00:21:38] GM: are his father we will need some liability um you i believe uh your son mentioned a state we can put
[00:21:46] GM: a lien against the estate if um if if you so wish hey give me a moment uh about five minutes later
[00:21:53] Berridin: My property in this city,
[00:21:56] Berridin: is that what you're saying?
[00:21:59] Berridin: Oh, sure, yeah, no problem.
[00:22:05] GM: she comes back with a large stack of papers uh please sign where it's x um just to know um we
[00:22:13] GM: will be able to give you a 1 000 1000 gold loan um however you do not repay it repay it we will
[00:22:19] GM: cease possession of your estate um payments start in one month um the payment turns out to be a
[00:22:22] Berridin: What, what, what, what's the payment terms?
[00:22:28] GM: are...
[00:22:30] GM: Fuck, I have to do math.
[00:22:35] Berridin: Well, uh,
[00:22:37] Ellara: what are the rates what are the rates because down the street offered me two percent
[00:22:38] Berridin: ma'am,
[00:22:39] GM: Yes.
[00:22:40] Berridin: can you,
[00:22:41] Ellara: oh my god bobby's bobby's furiously like researching like medieval punishment for
[00:22:41] Berridin: can you see my account?
[00:22:43] GM: The worst is...
[00:22:45] Berridin: Can you see my account
[00:22:46] Berridin: in your system?
[00:22:48] GM: Oh, we do have an account
[00:22:51] GM: for the estate in Bastion City where there
[00:22:53] GM: was funds from other institutes
[00:22:55] GM: transferred in. However, there's no
[00:22:57] GM: more funds, and
[00:22:58] GM: unless you were going to...
[00:23:01] GM: Unless you had a certified
[00:23:02] GM: statement from...
[00:23:05] GM: I believe from what I see
[00:23:07] GM: here is from the...
[00:23:09] GM: Fuck, I'm
[00:23:11] GM: doubting my own lore.
[00:23:13] GM: From the
[00:23:14] GM: Vasilian Banks, unless you have a certified
[00:23:14] Berridin: Yes, yes,
[00:23:17] GM: statement from the Vasilian
[00:23:19] GM: Banks that is
[00:23:21] GM: encoded magically, I wouldn't
[00:23:23] GM: be able to put funds in.
[00:23:26] GM: So the only way within
[00:23:27] GM: Bastion City and the purview of this bank
[00:23:29] GM: is to put a lien against
[00:23:31] GM: your current estate.
[00:23:33] GM: But I'm sure you'll be able to pay this, correct?
[00:23:35] GM: Um, hold on.
[00:23:37] Berridin: we'll handle it
[00:23:39] Berridin: in the coming...
[00:23:41] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: and say would we be able to do 2 000 against the property it's a really really nice property
[00:23:51] GM: I will have to...
[00:23:53] GM: We can do a thousand.
[00:23:55] GM: However, we...
[00:23:56] GM: For two thousand, we would have to go to City Hall
[00:23:59] GM: and pull up the records for
[00:24:01] GM: your estate to evaluate
[00:24:03] GM: and confirm the value.
[00:24:05] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: yeah it's going to take too long 1500 1100 how about how about just a water can i can i just get
[00:24:10] GM: Uh, one thousand.
[00:24:16] Berridin: That's my boy.
[00:24:20] GM: Um, so it will be starting
[00:24:22] GM: in a month's time. Um, it will be
[00:24:24] GM: a hundred gold monthly payment.
[00:24:26] GM: Um,
[00:24:27] Nyx: in blood and the bank tellers are fae
[00:24:30] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: a water and parched all right you got this done oh dad um walk away did you get the gold dad perfect
[00:24:33] GM: yes, there is a glass of water.
[00:24:35] GM: Uh, there is a self-serve,
[00:24:37] GM: like, little fountain with, like,
[00:24:39] GM: it's magically iced, like, cold
[00:24:41] GM: water, little paper cups.
[00:24:44] GM: Um,
[00:24:44] GM: yeah,
[00:24:49] Berridin: I mean, surely
[00:24:51] GM: and she's like, so, yes, it will
[00:24:53] GM: be starting in a month. It will be a hundred
[00:24:55] GM: gold a month repayment in a ten-month
[00:24:57] GM: repayment for a thousand gold
[00:24:59] GM: loan. Uh,
[00:25:01] GM: failure, uh, in the
[00:25:03] GM: first month, if you do not pay it, you will owe
[00:25:05] GM: the total immediately.
[00:25:08] GM: Unable to pay that total,
[00:25:09] GM: you will then, we will then,
[00:25:11] GM: um, take possession of the estate.
[00:25:15] Berridin: my meager property
[00:25:18] Berridin: here in the city
[00:25:20] Berridin: is worth significantly more than
[00:25:22] Berridin: 1,000 gold.
[00:25:24] GM: Oh, this is,
[00:25:26] GM: um, as I told your son, um,
[00:25:28] GM: apologies if you did
[00:25:30] GM: not hear, um, the thousand is
[00:25:32] GM: just a default kind of loan we
[00:25:34] GM: do give against any
[00:25:35] GM: nobility estate. If you would want a
[00:25:37] GM: larger loan, we will have to, um,
[00:25:40] GM: work with the city records, um,
[00:25:42] GM: and look at the evaluation of the
[00:25:43] GM: estate and fully evaluate it to understand
[00:25:45] GM: its full value. We cannot
[00:25:47] GM: guarantee any amount, um,
[00:25:50] GM: given in that process. It will be,
[00:25:51] GM: um, determined by, um, our
[00:25:53] GM: team. Excellent. Um,
[00:25:53] Berridin: Okay.
[00:26:00] Berridin: This should be enough for now.
[00:26:02] Berridin: We'll get the rest of it handled
[00:26:03] Berridin: in the future.
[00:26:06] GM: now, just sign these documents.
[00:26:09] GM: It's like a big pile of documents.
[00:26:11] Berridin: Okay, I start signing them
[00:26:14] Berridin: in very bad
[00:26:16] Berridin: handwriting.
[00:26:18] GM: Uh,
[00:26:21] Nyx: what are these mushrooms all around me what's going on
[00:26:21] GM: imagine.
[00:26:27] GM: Um,
[00:26:28] Nyx: rusty rucksack
[00:26:28] Berridin: I pocket the gold.

[00:26:35] GM: doing that, here is your thousand
[00:26:37] GM: gold pieces. Um, don't spend
[00:26:39] GM: it all at once. And, um,
[00:26:41] GM: we will, yeah, please
[00:26:43] GM: make your payments. It's like a
[00:26:51] GM: big bag. Like, you cannot pocket
[00:26:53] GM: it. Um, yeah,
[00:26:54] Berridin: Okay, I put it in my
[00:26:55] Berridin: in my bag.
[00:26:59] Berridin: Amazing.
[00:27:02] GM: so, yeah, she's
[00:27:04] GM: got a thousand
[00:27:07] GM: gold.
[00:27:11] Berridin: Good day.
[00:27:12] Berridin: Come along, Witty.
[00:27:14] GM: Oh my god. You know
[00:27:16] Berridin: I have the gold, and we shall

[00:27:35] Berridin: Alright, Witty,
[00:27:36] Berridin: like, uh,
[00:27:38] Berridin: there's probably something we should put a pin in

[00:28:00] Berridin: Sure, okay, yeah.
[00:28:01] Berridin: Okay, okay.
[00:28:02] Nyx: it's very concerning that Berridin is more concerned about this than witty
[00:28:08] Nyx: yeah yeah beyond you and figure that out can't be me go kill the button
[00:28:08] Berridin: That's alright.
[00:28:09] GM: I can be a big shrug.
[00:28:11] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: idea of like yeah like the concept of mortgages loans rent none of it uh it's it's all you know
[00:28:19] GM: Oh, yeah.
[00:28:19] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: cerebral or it's all yeah there for me yeah that sounds good to me no i mean you're the one

[00:28:24] Berridin: gold, um, for the
[00:28:26] Berridin: foreseeable future, um,
[00:28:28] Berridin: and then, um, we'll
[00:28:30] Berridin: try to figure out what we need to do with it later.
[00:28:35] Berridin: I love it.
[00:28:38] Nyx: oh my god oh my god yeah yeah in three different places
[00:28:39] Berridin: It's kind of like, you're my

[00:30:45] Berridin: I don't answer to you.
[00:30:49] Nyx: What's the number?
[00:30:49] Nyx: I want to know what we're dealing with.
[00:30:51] Nyx: What do we have?
[00:30:53] Nyx: It's very important.
[00:30:54] Berridin: We have a pool,
[00:30:55] Berridin: uh, we have, like, we have pretty much
[00:30:57] Berridin: the most gold I've ever seen in my entire
[00:30:59] Berridin: life. What? What?
[00:31:00] Nyx: Baradun.
[00:31:02] Nyx: I'm not going to ask again.
[00:31:03] Berridin: I don't have to answer to you anymore, okay? I'm, I'm a, I'm a,
[00:31:05] Berridin: I'm my own man.
[00:31:07] Nyx: Witty, how much money do you have?
[00:31:11] Nyx: How much did you...
[00:31:12] Nyx: How much did you...
[00:31:13] Nyx: I...
[00:31:15] Nyx: Okay.
[00:31:17] Nyx: All right.
[00:31:18] Nyx: How much did you withdraw from the bank?
[00:31:21] Nyx: Just so that we...
[00:31:25] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: withdraw the money 19 i did ask at one point for 2 000 gold
[00:31:27] Berridin: We withdrew, uh,
[00:31:28] Nyx: Baradun.
[00:31:29] Berridin: a sizable portion, and we could
[00:31:31] Berridin: use some help in paying off the loan.
[00:31:33] Berridin: We withdrew about 2,000 gold,
[00:31:35] Berridin: so, um,
[00:31:37] Berridin: it's, it's a little, it's a little tough out there.
[00:31:39] GM: Exactly.
[00:31:41] Nyx: Baradun.
[00:31:41] GM: Yeah.
[00:31:43] Nyx: My default is not to believe your numbers.
[00:31:43] Berridin: But,
[00:31:43] Berridin: you should believe it, because I've, I've
[00:31:46] Nyx: I believe you, but I don't believe your numbers.
[00:31:49] Nyx: So I'm going to try it again.
[00:31:51] Nyx: Please be reasonable.
[00:31:52] Nyx: How much did you actually...
[00:31:55] Berridin: never told a lie to you in my entire,
[00:31:57] Berridin: in my entire relationship.
[00:32:02] Nyx: Yeah, yeah.
[00:32:03] Nyx: This is...
[00:32:03] Berridin: Damn it.
[00:32:04] GM: Yes, it's not going great.
[00:32:08] Nyx: Yeah, no, no, no.
[00:32:10] Nyx: Just look.
[00:32:10] Ysidor: young one it's not good to lie can you lie yes it is a deception of
[00:32:10] GM: Um,
[00:32:13] Nyx: Yeah.
[00:32:14] Nyx: Look, I don't actually...
[00:32:16] Nyx: I'm not trying to find out
[00:32:19] Nyx: how much, how richer you are.
[00:32:21] Nyx: I just want to know,
[00:32:23] Nyx: moving forward,
[00:32:25] Nyx: what are our funds?
[00:32:27] Nyx: Because we make decisions off that.
[00:32:27] GM: um,
[00:32:35] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: you
[00:32:36] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: yeah i you know i could yeah i could use a renew hat witty on the other side just like starts
[00:32:38] Nyx: All right.
[00:32:38] Nyx: I'll go under that assumption.
[00:32:38] GM: I will,
[00:32:39] GM: okay, you could roll
[00:32:42] GM: an insight next if you
[00:32:44] GM: want it to.
[00:32:45] Nyx: I will, but yeah.
[00:32:46] GM: You have to beat a 19.
[00:32:49] Nyx: That's fine.
[00:32:50] Nyx: I got a plus four,
[00:32:51] Nyx: and I got a 19.
[00:32:53] Nyx: Beat it, meet it.
[00:32:54] Nyx: Meet it, beat it.
[00:32:57] GM: It is true
[00:32:58] GM: because he's like,
[00:33:00] GM: because he's second to it.
[00:33:02] GM: Does it?
[00:33:02] GM: Um, yeah.
[00:33:04] GM: You, for a second, I'll say
[00:33:06] GM: this next. When Whit says it,
[00:33:08] GM: you're like, like, when Whitty
[00:33:10] GM: says it, you're like, you really,
[00:33:12] GM: you almost want to believe it.
[00:33:14] GM: Like, almost had you
[00:33:15] Nyx: Yeah.
[00:33:16] GM: convinced. And then you,
[00:33:17] Nyx: Yeah.
[00:33:18] GM: then you just think about Whitty's and
[00:33:20] GM: Din's relationship up till now.
[00:33:21] Nyx: Yeah.
[00:33:22] Nyx: Because 2,000 would be such a fucking good number.
[00:33:26] Nyx: Such a good number.
[00:33:27] Nyx: Yeah.
[00:33:28] Berridin: You caught me.
[00:33:29] Nyx: Can you do that?
[00:33:29] Berridin: You caught me, bro.
[00:33:31] Berridin: It's 3,000.
[00:33:37] Ysidor: disadvantage we have healers who's guiding the carriage well I'll I'll do
[00:33:39] Nyx: Yeah, you can't just keep doing that.
[00:33:42] Nyx: What are the rules?
[00:33:46] Nyx: Because now I don't trust him at all.
[00:33:51] Nyx: How do we go about...
[00:33:53] Nyx: What do I roll?
[00:33:57] Nyx: Don't make me do a sleight of hand.
[00:33:58] GM: What is
[00:34:01] GM: Berridin enrolling?
[00:34:04] Berridin: Hold on, I'm trying to switch my, uh,
[00:34:05] GM: A deception with disadvantage, 17.
[00:34:07] Nyx: So what do I have to roll?
[00:34:09] GM: Insight,
[00:34:12] GM: I will say with advantage,
[00:34:14] GM: just at this point,
[00:34:15] Nyx: Okay, yeah.
[00:34:15] Nyx: I got a 16.
[00:34:16] Nyx: Let me roll again.
[00:34:18] GM: at this point,
[00:34:20] GM: like, you know
[00:34:22] Nyx: And then a six.
[00:34:24] GM: what? Yeah, so,
[00:34:24] Berridin: nailed it.
[00:34:25] Berridin: Are you, are you saying, Nyx, that you can
[00:34:26] GM: you're like, you can't quite believe
[00:34:28] GM: it, but then you're like, at this
[00:34:30] GM: point, like, who knows
[00:34:32] GM: between what you have
[00:34:34] GM: seen in their short relationship between
[00:34:36] GM: Whitty and Din?
[00:34:38] GM: Like, would it really surprise you if it was
[00:34:40] GM: $3,000 at the end of the day?
[00:34:42] GM: 3,000 gold at the end of the day?
[00:34:44] Nyx: Right.
[00:34:45] Nyx: Can I ask one more question to Baradun?
[00:34:48] Nyx: Yeah, I'm just going to say,
[00:34:48] GM: I mean, I'm not, I don't
[00:34:49] GM: truly hate this.
[00:34:50] Nyx: okay, I get that you're...
[00:34:52] Nyx: Okay, work with me here.
[00:34:54] Nyx: I get that you don't want to tell me the number.
[00:34:57] Nyx: I've conceded that.
[00:34:59] Nyx: Fine.
[00:35:00] Nyx: Is it over a thousand?
[00:35:03] Nyx: I just want to know what the minimum is.
[00:35:08] Nyx: Okay.
[00:35:09] Nyx: Because that can hurt us as a team if we don't know what the minimum is.
[00:35:13] Nyx: I don't care about how...
[00:35:16] Berridin: match the funds that we have?
[00:35:19] Nyx: No, I just want to know what the amount is.
[00:35:22] Nyx: So just give me the minimum.
[00:35:22] Berridin: I saw you,
[00:35:23] Berridin: I saw you a few days ago reach,
[00:35:25] Nyx: Minimum.
[00:35:26] Berridin: I reached into your
[00:35:28] Berridin: vault, randomly,
[00:35:30] Berridin: and pulled out 80 gold, okay?
[00:35:34] Berridin: Hey, I think,
[00:35:35] Nyx: Yeah.
[00:35:38] Berridin: why am I the one on trial here?
[00:35:40] Berridin: And I feel like you're, you've been holding out on us
[00:35:42] Berridin: this entire time.
[00:35:43] Nyx: I've been paying for shit.
[00:35:45] Berridin: Okay, that, that
[00:35:47] Nyx: I've been doing that hard work for everything.
[00:35:48] Berridin: dynamic shouldn't change.
[00:35:50] Berridin: This is, this is emergency
[00:35:52] Berridin: funds for
[00:35:54] Berridin: Witty and
[00:35:56] Berridin: I to live off of.
[00:35:58] Berridin: Very meager funds, okay?
[00:35:59] Berridin: We're gonna, we're gonna, we might, we might start
[00:36:02] Berridin: a Zeppelin business
[00:36:03] Berridin: in the future, so we're gonna need this, alright?
[00:36:09] Nyx: You win.
[00:36:10] Berridin: Yeah, that's right.
[00:36:11] Nyx: I'll drop it.
[00:36:12] Berridin: Yeah, that's right.
[00:36:13] Berridin: All right.
[00:36:20] Ellara: weeks and they're just kind of like tilts her head because i i suppose i thought we would just
[00:36:22] Nyx: I mean, we need money for...
[00:36:24] Nyx: That's two weeks.
[00:36:25] Nyx: However long we're going to be out there, right?
[00:36:27] Nyx: We need to buy supplies.
[00:36:30] Nyx: We need to buy...
[00:36:31] Nyx: We might need passage.
[00:36:33] Nyx: Pay for passage.
[00:36:34] Nyx: We might need who knows what.
[00:36:36] Nyx: And these things can become expensive
[00:36:40] Nyx: when you're out on the road.
[00:36:41] Nyx: Especially with a party of this many people.
[00:36:45] Nyx: That's all.
[00:36:53] Ellara: live off the land
[00:36:54] Ellara: like anyone does when they're traveling he's the uh what's he what is he the the dean dean
[00:36:59] Nyx: I mean, we will
[00:36:59] Nyx: to the best of our ability that we can.
[00:37:03] Nyx: But there are other things.
[00:37:04] Nyx: Let's say
[00:37:05] Nyx: we need passage.
[00:37:08] Nyx: That's really the big one that comes to mind.
[00:37:10] Nyx: To get places, you need to spend money.
[00:37:14] Nyx: And that can become expensive.
[00:37:16] Nyx: And it's not five gold here,
[00:37:18] Nyx: five gold there
[00:37:19] Nyx: that's going to make things happen.
[00:37:21] Nyx: Anyways, I'm speaking in...
[00:37:24] Nyx: Yeah, I'm just making stuff up at this point.
[00:37:29] Nyx: We have not left yet.
[00:37:30] Nyx: So let's just drop it
[00:37:32] Nyx: and we'll take it as it comes.
[00:37:39] Nyx: We'll be fine.
[00:37:40] Berridin: Let's do it.
[00:37:41] Berridin: We have, we have too much healing.
[00:37:43] GM: Anything else for
[00:37:44] GM: the evening?
[00:37:44] GM: I mean, we,
[00:37:48] GM: we talked money,
[00:37:49] GM: people got ready
[00:37:52] GM: to travel.
[00:37:54] Nyx: Do we have potions?
[00:37:54] GM: Anything else?
[00:37:55] Nyx: Do we have...
[00:37:56] Nyx: Well, no, we actually have spells we don't need.
[00:37:59] Nyx: This time around, we actually have...
[00:38:00] Nyx: I've got cure wounds.
[00:38:01] GM: Yes.
[00:38:02] Nyx: Wow.
[00:38:04] GM: Wow.
[00:38:05] GM: For once, some people
[00:38:07] Nyx: We can heal.
[00:38:09] GM: prepared.
[00:38:11] Nyx: Yeah, we learned...
[00:38:13] Berridin: Yeah, I'm not an animal person.
[00:38:14] Nyx: We overcompensated.
[00:38:16] GM: I mean,
[00:38:17] GM: will you?
[00:38:19] Nyx: Yeah, it's true.
[00:38:20] GM: Yeah, so,
[00:38:21] Nyx: I think we're good to go.
[00:38:23] Nyx: So, like, what, like, a rest?
[00:38:24] Nyx: Do we think we should just go to bed?
[00:38:25] Nyx: Early.
[00:38:25] GM: it's a long rest.
[00:38:28] GM: Yeah, you
[00:38:29] GM: have all a nice sleep
[00:38:31] GM: in the Whittaker estate.
[00:38:33] GM: It's bright and early
[00:38:37] GM: in the morning. I assume you guys
[00:38:39] GM: kind of get up early to get a good head
[00:38:41] GM: start of your day.
[00:38:42] Nyx: Yeah, I'm on the horse.
[00:38:44] GM: The horses,
[00:38:46] GM: you know, I'll say there is,
[00:38:47] GM: there was some old feed
[00:38:49] GM: in the stables
[00:38:50] GM: that were empty, but, like, where the
[00:38:53] GM: chariot was, there was some feed there. You're
[00:38:55] GM: able to, like, feed the horses, take care of
[00:38:57] GM: them. Anything
[00:38:59] GM: before
[00:39:01] GM: you depart, anything?
[00:39:03] GM: Okay, so, two horses
[00:39:05] Nyx: I'm not in the carriage.
[00:39:09] GM: pulling the carriage.
[00:39:10] GM: Nyx is riding a horse. Who
[00:39:13] GM: is guiding the carriage?
[00:39:18] Nyx: It's up to all y'all.
[00:39:19] Nyx: Yeah.
[00:39:19] GM: Yeah, who's the driver?
[00:39:20] Nyx: Who's the driver?
[00:39:22] Nyx: One of you.
[00:39:23] Ysidor: it I don't trust the city folks what oh I actually do have a bonus
[00:39:25] Nyx: Perfect.
[00:39:26] Nyx: I'm cool with it.
[00:39:27] GM: Nyx
[00:39:27] GM: and Ysidor, animal handling.
[00:39:30] Nyx: Oh, goddammit.
[00:39:32] Nyx: I'm actually...
[00:39:35] Nyx: I got a bonus, too.
[00:39:35] Ysidor: uh yeah 15 shocking another lie the shade when a liar is done when she's
[00:39:37] Nyx: What'd I get?
[00:39:38] Nyx: I got a 12.
[00:39:39] Berridin: Oh!
[00:39:40] GM: Yeah, you always
[00:39:42] GM: see, I'll say, for
[00:39:44] GM: Ysidor, you see him, like, go on
[00:39:46] GM: and, like, I feel like, Ysidor,
[00:39:48] GM: from your, like, growing, like, you've
[00:39:50] GM: done farm work and that, and, like,
[00:39:52] GM: this is the same, like, very
[00:39:54] GM: much comfortable, natural,
[00:39:56] GM: kind of, just getting the horses
[00:39:57] GM: ready to go. Nyx,
[00:40:02] GM: the mare's a little bit
[00:40:03] GM: temperamental. You know, you have to,
[00:40:04] Nyx: Yeah.
[00:40:05] Nyx: I gotta put the work in.
[00:40:06] GM: like,
[00:40:07] GM: going fine, but you just kind of have
[00:40:09] GM: to sometimes persuade
[00:40:11] GM: her a little to listen fully,
[00:40:13] GM: but, like, yeah,
[00:40:15] GM: you've got to put a little bit, not a lot,
[00:40:17] Nyx: Yeah, just a little work.
[00:40:18] Nyx: Yeah, I get it.
[00:40:19] GM: a little work.
[00:40:20] Nyx: All right.
[00:40:20] GM: Yeah, maybe it's been
[00:40:21] GM: a while since you,
[00:40:22] GM: but, yeah, you just see Ysidor,
[00:40:25] GM: like, with,
[00:40:27] GM: the reins, the horses,
[00:40:29] GM: giddy up. You're able,
[00:40:31] GM: as you kind of go across the
[00:40:33] GM: bridge,
[00:40:34] GM: you kind of enter the
[00:40:37] GM: east side of Bastion City. You're
[00:40:39] GM: following the roads. Remember, there's
[00:40:41] GM: the light crystal lanterns all
[00:40:43] GM: on the main road. You
[00:40:45] GM: go to the guard gates. They're
[00:40:47] GM: really there more for people coming in than
[00:40:49] GM: going out. And
[00:40:51] GM: you see, like, the sleeping,
[00:40:54] GM: what do you call it,
[00:40:55] GM: Warforged on the
[00:40:57] GM: side.
[00:40:57] GM: I deactivate it.
[00:40:59] GM: And soon out that, you're
[00:41:01] GM: on the main road.
[00:41:04] GM: As you kind of
[00:41:05] GM: are outside the walls of
[00:41:07] GM: Bastion City, there's still, like, houses
[00:41:09] GM: and farmlands and that. It's not completely
[00:41:11] GM: desolate. Like, there is a
[00:41:13] GM: whole kind of economy outside the city
[00:41:15] GM: that sustains the city, as this is
[00:41:17] GM: the capital and that. So, obviously, within
[00:41:19] GM: city walls, you're not going to have farms.
[00:41:21] GM: So, I would say,
[00:41:22] GM: yeah, as you're
[00:41:25] GM: going,
[00:41:26] GM: um,
[00:41:27] GM: you're making good time.
[00:41:29] GM: Uh, there are, as you go further
[00:41:31] GM: and further, less people on the road.
[00:41:34] GM: Um, as the sun goes down
[00:41:36] GM: and that, uh, there's some obvious
[00:41:38] GM: spots to make camp. Um,
[00:41:42] GM: yeah. Um, so,
[00:41:42] Berridin: Can I talk with, um, at some point
[00:41:44] Berridin: during the day, can I have a conversation
[00:41:46] Berridin: with Ellara? Oh.
[00:41:49] GM: I would say, in the back of the
[00:41:51] GM: wagon, uh, in the chariot, wait,
[00:41:53] GM: this is a proper chariot, isn't it?
[00:41:56] GM: Um, this, yeah, so,
[00:41:58] GM: I don't know how you're configured, but you would be enclosed.
[00:42:01] GM: Nice and padded. Um, you, Ellara, and Witty
[00:42:05] GM: in the back. I, I don't know, um, how private of a conversation you'd be able to have,
[00:42:11] GM: or, um, you could choose to have it when you camp,
[00:42:14] GM: if you want it to be private.
[00:42:15] GM: Well, he's the dean, dean of the seminary. He's in charge of the whole seminary.
[00:42:16] Berridin: Oh, no, I can, um, I don't mind
[00:42:18] Berridin: if everyone overhears.
[00:42:21] Berridin: Um,
[00:42:22] Berridin: so,
[00:42:24] Berridin: I'm writing with Ellara.
[00:42:26] Berridin: Um, okay.
[00:42:28] Berridin: Um,
[00:42:30] Berridin: Ellara, um,
[00:42:32] Berridin: what, what, what do you know,
[00:42:34] Berridin: or can you explain your relationship with
[00:42:36] Berridin: Proctor Eduard?
[00:42:46] Ellara: is that yeah like he's the dean of the seminary he's one of the most respected eulogians in the
[00:42:51] GM: Hold to assume.
[00:42:55] Ellara: city well he has been quite trustworthy and has helped us so many times already and is looking
[00:42:56] Berridin: But, what, what do you think of him?
[00:42:59] Berridin: Do you like him?
[00:43:06] Ellara: into it at the looking into the situation at the highest levels of government he just takes time
[00:43:12] Ellara: he just grabs your
[00:43:14] Berridin: Um, I'm, I go into
[00:43:16] Berridin: my most, uh,
[00:43:19] Berridin: cherub-looking, like,
[00:43:20] Berridin: halfling state that I could
[00:43:22] Berridin: muster, and
[00:43:24] Berridin: I, I walk over
[00:43:26] Berridin: the shortnesses and sit
[00:43:28] Berridin: beside her, and I put my
[00:43:30] Berridin: hand on
[00:43:32] Berridin: Ellara, uh, Ellara's
[00:43:34] Ellara: hand and moves it out away and now she just like grabs it more forcefully and
[00:43:34] Berridin: head. Okay.
[00:43:36] Berridin: I put it, I try to put it on
[00:43:38] Berridin: her, uh,
[00:43:40] Berridin: um, her knee.
[00:43:41] Berridin: Okay.
[00:43:46] Ellara: lambs it away he just kind of goes i know that you have asked me to question her multiple times but
[00:43:48] Berridin: Look, Ellara,
[00:43:50] Berridin: there comes a time when
[00:43:52] Berridin: we have to face some hard truths
[00:43:54] Berridin: in life, and
[00:43:56] Berridin: I just need you to be prepared,
[00:43:59] Berridin: and I know that we haven't
[00:44:00] Berridin: gotten along swimmingly
[00:44:04] Berridin: so far, but,
[00:44:06] Berridin: um, I overheard
[00:44:08] Berridin: something that
[00:44:10] Berridin: Proctor Eduard said during
[00:44:12] Berridin: the party, and
[00:44:14] Berridin: I need you to hear it, I need
[00:44:16] Berridin: you to trust me, and then
[00:44:18] Berridin: I need you to
[00:44:20] Berridin: understand what I'm,
[00:44:22] Berridin: what I'm, what I'm experiencing.
[00:44:25] Berridin: Um, and so,
[00:44:26] Berridin: during the party,
[00:44:28] Berridin: uh, I stealthily
[00:44:30] Berridin: overheard some
[00:44:32] Berridin: of the bigwigs
[00:44:34] Berridin: at the party, uh,
[00:44:36] Berridin: um, it was the
[00:44:38] Berridin: Duke and the
[00:44:40] Berridin: the Princess
[00:44:42] Berridin: and, um,
[00:44:44] Berridin: Proctor Eduard and
[00:44:45] Berridin: Donathan Reeves, um,
[00:44:48] Berridin: and they were
[00:44:50] Berridin: kind of nefariously
[00:44:51] Berridin: talking about,
[00:44:53] Berridin: um, the
[00:44:56] Berridin: the light crystal
[00:44:58] Berridin: shenanigans that we've been
[00:45:00] Berridin: dealing with. Um,
[00:45:02] Berridin: Proctor Eduard is,
[00:45:04] Berridin: seems to be intimately aware,
[00:45:06] Berridin: and I know that
[00:45:08] Berridin: you might, um,
[00:45:10] Berridin: I know that you trust him,
[00:45:12] Berridin: but he seemed to have been in
[00:45:14] Berridin: cahoots with Donathan
[00:45:16] Berridin: Reeves and the Duke,
[00:45:18] Berridin: and, um,
[00:45:21] Berridin: yeah, yeah, I know I
[00:45:29] Ellara: it is it is not good to lie master burden you're telling me that you snuck up to the
[00:45:35] Ellara: four most powerful people in the party and they did not notice you that seems you know quite
[00:45:44] Berridin: haven't really established
[00:45:45] Berridin: an, uh, an aura of, uh,
[00:45:48] Berridin: trust in the things that I've done
[00:45:49] Berridin: so far,
[00:45:50] Berridin: but,
[00:45:52] Berridin: going through, Baradun's going through a lot of trouble,
[00:45:53] Nyx: Understatement of the campaign.
[00:45:57] Ellara: i know i have cried i know i have cried wolf many a time but what
[00:45:57] Berridin: his head's like,
[00:46:01] Nyx: Oh, you can't hear me.
[00:46:01] Berridin: okay,
[00:46:04] Berridin: um, I also,
[00:46:06] Berridin: I, you know, I, I, I, I
[00:46:08] Berridin: relayed this conversation to
[00:46:10] Berridin: Nyx, and,
[00:46:11] Berridin: um,
[00:46:14] Berridin: who else was there? Was Ysidor,
[00:46:15] Berridin: Ysidor was there, too, right after the
[00:46:17] Berridin: party. Um,
[00:46:19] Berridin: I didn't know how to use the record
[00:46:21] Berridin: function on the sending stones, but
[00:46:24] Berridin: just, just
[00:46:25] Ellara: she just kind of nods at you very like yeah oh he did he just kind of laughs a little
[00:46:25] Berridin: know this,
[00:46:26] Berridin: that,
[00:46:27] Berridin: that,
[00:46:27] Berridin: that,
[00:46:28] GM: I will, so, my thing right now to adjudicate, I'm just folding laundry and paying attention,
[00:46:29] Berridin: that.
[00:46:35] Berridin: Alari,
[00:46:38] Berridin: there's one more thing that I, I, I think
[00:46:40] Berridin: you should know, and I know, I know
[00:46:42] Berridin: that you don't trust me or anything, but
[00:46:44] Berridin: he specifically, Edward
[00:46:46] Berridin: specifically mentioned
[00:46:48] Berridin: you in this conversation,
[00:46:50] Berridin: and he,
[00:46:52] Berridin: he said that
[00:46:54] Berridin: he had, um,
[00:46:56] Berridin: he had you wrapped around
[00:46:58] Berridin: his finger,
[00:47:00] Berridin: um,
[00:47:00] Berridin: okay, I'm just,
[00:47:02] Ellara: i'm sure thank thank you so much for telling me about this i understand you want to make me wary
[00:47:07] Berridin: oh,
[00:47:07] Berridin: oh,
[00:47:08] Berridin: I feel like I haven't done a good job
[00:47:10] Berridin: of explaining the gravity of the situation to you.
[00:47:18] Ellara: but next time maybe try something more believable but i i am careful i'm not going to lie to you
[00:47:25] Ellara: don't worry but come on master baradun you have you have done many more believable things than
[00:47:34] Ellara: this perhaps if you um did not lie so much i would be more likely to believe you switches
[00:47:36] Berridin: This is, you know, I'm taking that to heart,
[00:47:37] Ysidor: like okay this is enough that's what you are
[00:47:52] Berridin: kind of reevaluating my whole MO here.
[00:47:57] Berridin: All I need to do,
[00:47:58] Berridin: I attempt to take her hand one last time.
[00:48:02] Ellara: sides to the other side of the carriage yeah no no you weren't there yeah you were you were out
[00:48:08] Berridin: As one last plea,
[00:48:10] Berridin: I'm going to cast my Disguise Self again.
[00:48:17] Berridin: And in the manner,
[00:48:22] Berridin: I'm going to disguise myself as Proctor Eduard,
[00:48:25] Berridin: and I'm going to repeat the words that I had heard
[00:48:29] Berridin: and I had relayed to her.
[00:48:31] Berridin: And I would like to roll a performance check
[00:48:35] Berridin: to see how well I do.
[00:48:38] Berridin: Is that fair?
[00:48:47] GM: uh, to adjudicate this, is.
[00:48:47] Berridin: Yeah.
[00:48:52] GM: I will say, you can perform, you can roll your performance check flat- your performance flat,
[00:48:58] GM: I will allow Ellara to determine however she feels about it, it won't be contested for her to believe it.
[00:49:03] Berridin: Yeah.
[00:49:06] GM: Or not, it's a character.
[00:49:06] Berridin: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:49:07] Berridin: I agree with it.
[00:49:08] Berridin: Okay, that's fine.
[00:49:09] GM: Yep.
[00:49:09] Berridin: So do I just roll a d20,
[00:49:12] Berridin: or can I roll my ability?
[00:49:13] GM: Yeah, your performance. Your actual performance. Whatever it is.
[00:49:15] Berridin: Okay, okay, okay.
[00:49:16] Berridin: I thought you said flat,
[00:49:17] Berridin: so I was just kind of confused.
[00:49:18] GM: Oh yeah, uh, flat means without advantage or disadvantage.
[00:49:22] GM: ten
[00:49:22] Berridin: Okay, I mean, it is flat.
[00:49:24] GM: the most middle of the road
[00:49:24] Berridin: It's 10.
[00:49:28] GM: of anything
[00:49:28] Berridin: Middle of the road.
[00:49:29] GM: in the middle of the road
[00:49:30] Berridin: Middle of the road performance here.
[00:49:33] GM: well you and
[00:49:34] Berridin: Okay.
[00:49:35] Berridin: And I wrap up,
[00:49:37] Berridin: and I think like,
[00:49:38] Berridin: okay, that's going to do it.
[00:49:39] Berridin: That's going to convince her.
[00:49:44] Ysidor: a lot of cocks a gun
[00:49:44] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: clapping because i'm just i'm i'm shocked listening to to all this because i don't i
[00:49:46] Berridin: You are done.
[00:49:51] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: don't remember anything i didn't know anything about it yeah yeah i don't know anything about
[00:49:54] GM: Justin
[00:49:54] GM: when you said the lines are going to catch up
[00:49:56] Ellara: she she just kind of nods and says i do hope you were being honest when you said you are reflecting
[00:49:57] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: it so so what's your name and is that a mrs samantha or
[00:50:05] Ellara: about
[00:50:05] Ellara: the way you act but i suppose that was a okay impression of him i i don't really understand
[00:50:16] Ellara: what you were trying to do but who knows she's just kind of like i i think the one that needs
[00:50:23] Berridin: Just, just,
[00:50:24] Berridin: just,
[00:50:25] Berridin: careful.
[00:50:25] Berridin: You, you, you,
[00:50:26] Berridin: you understand that I,
[00:50:27] Berridin: I,
[00:50:28] Berridin: I,
[00:50:29] Berridin: I just want you to be careful.
[00:50:33] Berridin: You know that,
[00:50:33] Berridin: that,
[00:50:34] Berridin: that is true, right?
[00:50:39] Ellara: to be careful is you one of these days your lies will catch up to you and you know just kind of
[00:50:46] Ellara: nods is that the estate or what
[00:50:50] Berridin: I think that's successful.
[00:50:57] Berridin: That was a,
[00:51:02] Ellara: oh well she maybe she's during the road she'll be reading the book that the guy gave her um but
[00:51:04] Berridin: that was a,
[00:51:04] Berridin: yeah.
[00:51:07] GM: I feel like y'all are going to forget
[00:51:08] Ysidor: Oh
[00:51:09] Berridin: It's perfect.
[00:51:11] GM: about it
[00:51:11] GM: you come back

[00:51:22] GM: it was
[00:51:23] GM: you just want to call that out yeah so
[00:51:26] GM: I guess there's probably an awkward silence
[00:51:28] GM: in the carriage right now
[00:51:30] GM: at least between Din and
[00:51:32] GM: Ellara
[00:51:32] GM: but yeah
[00:51:36] GM: I'd say your day
[00:51:38] GM: goes on pretty without events

[01:03:09] Berridin: yeah.

[01:03:22] Berridin: the insight and,
[01:03:23] Berridin: you know,
[01:03:23] Berridin: the,
[01:03:23] Berridin: the,
[01:03:23] Berridin: the,

[01:03:25] Berridin: if you want to go through it.
[01:03:26] Nyx: I mean, I...
[01:03:27] Nyx: Nyx would passively be trying to see what he can about them without bothering her.
[01:03:35] Nyx: So I'm happy to roll whatever, Bobby, to be passive on this and not draw attention.
[01:03:36] Berridin: Okay.
[01:03:36] Berridin: Yeah.
[01:03:44] Nyx: What do you want me to roll?
[01:03:45] Nyx: I want to know if the story she's telling...
[01:03:46] Berridin: Passive perception.
[01:03:50] GM: you trying what are you focusing on so you want to know the truth of her story okay and you and
[01:03:57] Nyx: makes sense.
[01:04:00] Nyx: I just want to figure out anything.
[01:04:02] Nyx: Any information about where she's from.
[01:04:06] Nyx: Like, truth.
[01:04:15] Nyx: Yeah.
[01:04:16] Nyx: To the best.
[01:04:16] Nyx: I know it's impossible without asking to get a real, real answer.
[01:04:21] Nyx: You know, actually, no.
[01:04:22] Nyx: I take that back.
[01:04:23] Nyx: Sorry, I'm thinking this through.
[01:04:25] Nyx: Nyx would want to know if she's a threat or not.
[01:04:29] Nyx: I think that's the most important thing.
[01:04:32] Nyx: Not her soul.
[01:04:32] Berridin: Yeah, I like that.
[01:04:33] Nyx: Yeah.
[01:04:33] Berridin: Everyone else is oblivious.
[01:04:34] GM: so you're looking at her um
[01:04:36] Nyx: Yeah.
[01:04:44] GM: roll roll roll an investigation at 14 that was what you needed at 14
[01:04:46] Nyx: Everyone else is, like, being nice to her.

[01:04:49] Nyx: All right.
[01:04:51] Berridin: Oh,

[01:05:08] GM: you realize because you've seen this before this is not her disguise like this is not
[01:05:19] GM: this is a disguise this is um this is a spell this is
[01:05:25] GM: this guy's self and for a moment you see just beyond it you see something familiar
[01:05:36] GM: so and it's interesting that nicks of all people did this someone same industry same kind of worker
[01:05:47] GM: no it's not michelle faberge it is not michelle faberge she's not i should bring her back as like
[01:05:47] Berridin: Wait.

[01:12:32] GM: She casts hold person, fourth level.
[01:12:38] GM: No.
[01:12:38] Berridin: Fourth level.
[01:12:41] GM: So this is a wisdom saving throw for Nyx, Ellara, and Ysidor.
[01:12:49] GM: Wisdom saving throw.
[01:12:52] Nyx: I got a 14.
[01:12:53] Ellara: which is a modified human thing no no but that's ability checks i think it's rare for them to need
[01:12:57] Nyx: Ooh!
[01:12:58] Nyx: Dirty 20.
[01:12:59] Nyx: 21.
[01:13:03] GM: You all save.
[01:13:04] GM: 14 was the save.
[01:13:06] Nyx: Ooh!
[01:13:06] Berridin: Wow.
[01:13:11] GM: Yeah, so wait.
[01:13:11] GM: Going back to the battle, like, well, that didn't work.
[01:13:18] GM: That's their action.
[01:13:20] GM: They don't have any other action there.
[01:13:24] GM: So Nyx, it's your turn.
[01:13:28] Nyx: Ongoing...
[01:13:28] Nyx: Wow, it's been a while.
[01:13:31] GM: I know.
[01:13:33] Nyx: Let's do...
[01:13:37] Nyx: Yeah.
[01:13:37] Nyx: So I'm going to attack...
[01:13:40] Nyx: I'm going to do a dreadful...
[01:13:43] Nyx: I'm going to attack with my crossbow.
[01:13:44] Nyx: And I'm going to do a dreadful strike.
[01:13:46] Nyx: And that is once per turn.
[01:13:48] Nyx: When you attack...
[01:13:49] Nyx: I can do this twice.
[01:13:50] Nyx: But when you attack a creature and hit it with your weapon,
[01:13:53] Nyx: you deal an extra 2d6 psychic damage.
[01:13:57] Nyx: And you can do it two times per long rest.
[01:13:59] Nyx: So I'm going to do that once.
[01:14:00] Nyx: And I also have Vex.
[01:14:00] GM: Yeah.
[01:14:03] GM: Well, you have to attack first.
[01:14:04] Nyx: Yeah.
[01:14:05] Nyx: I'm just saying...
[01:14:06] Nyx: Because I'm weird.
[01:14:07] Nyx: And if I hit a creature with my hand crossbow,
[01:14:10] Nyx: which is what I'm using,
[01:14:12] Nyx: and you deal damage to it,
[01:14:13] Nyx: you have advantage to your next attack roll
[01:14:15] Nyx: against the creature before the end of your next turn.
[01:14:18] Nyx: So now I'm just going to attack.
[01:14:20] Nyx: I think that's all I can do.
[01:14:22] GM: And then you can use your Dreadful Strike.
[01:14:25] Nyx: Okay.
[01:14:25] Nyx: Yeah.
[01:14:25] GM: 13 does not hit.
[01:14:26] Nyx: Okay.
[01:14:27] Nyx: So we're going to go with...
[01:14:28] Nyx: I do hit.
[01:14:31] Nyx: I got a 13.
[01:14:34] Nyx: Oh, it does not.
[01:14:35] GM: No.
[01:14:37] Nyx: Ooh.
[01:14:38] Nyx: Okay.
[01:14:41] GM: Bonus action and movement.
[01:14:44] Nyx: Anything I can hide behind near me?
[01:14:44] GM: You could run into the woods.
[01:14:46] Nyx: Let me just see.
[01:14:47] Nyx: Let me look at the map.
[01:14:49] GM: I will say the map is fairly accurate.
[01:14:51] GM: You could get partial cover in the woods.
[01:14:54] Nyx: I'll do it.
[01:14:55] GM: Move your character.
[01:14:56] GM: You guys can move your own tokens.
[01:14:58] Nyx: Okay.
[01:14:59] Nyx: Yeah.
[01:14:59] Nyx: Let me go back to...
[01:14:59] GM: Oh, Matt, for your reference, the square is five feet.
[01:15:00] Ysidor: augie looks like he has initiative
[01:15:03] GM: And you can move your own tokens.
[01:15:05] GM: Okay.
[01:15:06] GM: And so to move one square, you move five feet.
[01:15:09] GM: How far you can move is in your character sheet.
[01:15:11] GM: So you're 30 feet.
[01:15:13] GM: Yeah.
[01:15:14] Nyx: I'm going to go over here.
[01:15:18] GM: Okay.
[01:15:20] GM: Cool.
[01:15:21] GM: Next turn.
[01:15:22] GM: Baradun, your turn.

[01:15:26] Berridin: we only see this bandit receiver,
[01:15:28] Berridin: right?
[01:15:28] Berridin: Bandit deceiver.
[01:15:29] Berridin: Sorry.
[01:15:29] Berridin: Right.
[01:15:30] GM: Only person.
[01:15:30] Berridin: That's the only.
[01:15:31] Berridin: Okay.
[01:15:32] GM: Yeah.
[01:15:33] Berridin: Okay.
[01:15:34] Berridin: I'm going to whip out my,
[01:15:36] Berridin: my double scimitars.
[01:15:39] GM: Mm-hmm.
[01:15:41] Berridin: I cast my phantom hex on her.
[01:15:48] Berridin: Um,
[01:15:49] GM: What kind of, what do I have to roll?
[01:15:51] GM: Wait.
[01:15:51] Berridin: this is just,
[01:15:53] Berridin: this is just a bonus.
[01:15:54] Berridin: This is like,
[01:15:54] Berridin: uh,
[01:15:55] Berridin: this is like hex except my own version.
[01:15:57] Berridin: It's uh,
[01:15:59] Berridin: um,
[01:15:59] Berridin: she just has disadvantage on ability checks.
[01:16:03] GM: There's a save.
[01:16:03] Berridin: Um,
[01:16:04] GM: There should be a save for that.
[01:16:06] GM: There's not a save?
[01:16:08] Berridin: no,
[01:16:08] Berridin: no,
[01:16:08] Berridin: this is,
[01:16:09] Berridin: this is like,
[01:16:09] Berridin: um,
[01:16:10] Berridin: this is like hex.
[01:16:10] Berridin: This is like the hex cast.
[01:16:12] Berridin: Um,
[01:16:12] Berridin: it's a,
[01:16:12] Berridin: it's a,
[01:16:13] Berridin: it's a bonus action and it every time until the spell ends.
[01:16:18] Berridin: Um,
[01:16:19] Berridin: I deal extra one D six psychic damage on the target whenever I hit it with an attack.
[01:16:26] GM: Brock.
[01:16:27] Nyx: Brutal.
[01:16:27] GM: No.
[01:16:28] Berridin: Yeah,
[01:16:28] Berridin: I can,
[01:16:29] Berridin: I can,
[01:16:29] Berridin: I can combo this with other people.
[01:16:31] Berridin: I just don't know what you guys are.
[01:16:33] Berridin: If you could,
[01:16:34] Berridin: if you guys have any like,
[01:16:35] Berridin: um,
[01:16:36] Berridin: ability checks that you use with your spells,
[01:16:38] Berridin: just let me know.
[01:16:38] Berridin: Cause I can make her have a disadvantage on it.
[01:16:40] Nyx: Ooh.
[01:16:41] Nyx: That's cool.
[01:16:45] Ellara: an ability check mid-fight right like they're not doing like a performance mid-fight or something
[01:16:45] Berridin: Yeah.
[01:16:47] Berridin: I,
[01:16:47] Berridin: yeah.
[01:16:49] Ellara: all right or is ability
[01:16:50] GM: So it's one ability.
[01:16:50] Berridin: Yeah.
[01:16:50] Berridin: I think like,
[01:16:51] Berridin: yeah.
[01:16:52] Berridin: So I'll go ahead.
[01:16:53] Berridin: What were you gonna say?
[01:16:56] GM: So that means you pick one ability.
[01:17:00] GM: Hold on.
[01:17:03] GM: I need to.
[01:17:04] GM: I think ability is the stat block.
[01:17:04] Ellara: something else uh how often do they do ability checks i guess if a save is an ability that's
[01:17:14] Berridin: I think it's like,
[01:17:15] GM: Ability has to, yeah.
[01:17:16] Berridin: yeah.
[01:17:17] GM: So this is like strength saves and all that.
[01:17:19] GM: Yeah.
[01:17:19] Berridin: Yeah.
[01:17:19] Berridin: Yeah.
[01:17:19] Berridin: Yeah.
[01:17:20] GM: So you pick one of the main stats.
[01:17:21] Ellara: insane so like when you do like do a raw intelligence check that kind of thing that's
[01:17:21] Berridin: Yeah.
[01:17:21] Berridin: Yeah.
[01:17:22] GM: No.
[01:17:22] Berridin: Yeah.
[01:17:22] Berridin: Yeah.
[01:17:24] GM: So skill is when you do deception.
[01:17:26] GM: Ability is technically like when,
[01:17:29] GM: when you do like, for example,
[01:17:32] GM: it refers to your scores.
[01:17:38] Berridin: Yeah.
[01:17:38] Berridin: Yeah.
[01:17:38] Berridin: Yeah.
[01:17:38] Berridin: Yeah.
[01:17:38] Berridin: Yeah.
[01:17:38] Berridin: Yeah.
[01:17:38] Berridin: Yeah.
[01:17:38] Berridin: Yeah.
[01:17:38] Berridin: Yeah.
[01:17:41] GM: Or.
[01:17:41] Berridin: I know you're supposed to like,
[01:17:42] Berridin: like when,
[01:17:42] Berridin: whenever they ask for like a save or something,
[01:17:44] Berridin: that's when usually we can,
[01:17:45] GM: Yeah.
[01:17:46] GM: It's one of those.
[01:17:46] Berridin: we can use it.
[01:17:47] GM: Yeah.
[01:17:48] GM: So you have to pick one of the stats
[01:17:49] GM: to have a disadvantage in.
[01:17:50] Berridin: Yeah.
[01:17:51] Berridin: So I don't know.
[01:17:52] Berridin: Usually it's like wisdom or something or things that could happen.
[01:17:55] Berridin: So I'm,
[01:17:56] Ellara: insane how do you my mind is broken it seems insane you can't save
[01:17:56] Berridin: I'm just gonna,
[01:17:56] Berridin: it's just a disadvantage.
[01:18:01] Ellara: huh okay that's that's a busted ass skill
[01:18:02] GM: Well, it's just, yeah.
[01:18:04] GM: But even normal hex like that.
[01:18:06] GM: Yeah.
[01:18:07] GM: But it's concentration.
[01:18:07] Berridin: Yeah.
[01:18:08] GM: So I can break concentration.
[01:18:10] GM: Yeah.
[01:18:10] Berridin: He can,
[01:18:10] Berridin: he can,
[01:18:11] Berridin: she can break concentration.
[01:18:12] Nyx: Yeah.
[01:18:12] Berridin: Yeah.
[01:18:13] Nyx: Yeah.
[01:18:15] GM: Yeah.
[01:18:17] Ellara: you're on fire you you strike through the fire so your limiter lights up so i'm next to him so
[01:18:19] Berridin: Um,
[01:18:20] Berridin: anyway.
[01:18:20] Berridin: Uh,
[01:18:21] Berridin: okay.
[01:18:21] Berridin: Yeah.
[01:18:21] Berridin: I'll,
[01:18:21] Berridin: I'll just choose wisdom,
[01:18:22] Berridin: I guess.
[01:18:23] GM: Okay.
[01:18:23] Berridin: Um,
[01:18:23] Berridin: and then I'm gonna,
[01:18:24] Berridin: I'm gonna,
[01:18:25] Berridin: I'm gonna do my attack with the scimitars.
[01:18:28] GM: You have to move into range, but.
[01:18:29] Berridin: Um,
[01:18:29] Berridin: yeah,
[01:18:31] Berridin: let me move into range.
[01:18:32] Berridin: Sorry.
[01:18:33] Berridin: Uh,
[01:18:33] Berridin: let me go to the screen.
[01:18:36] Berridin: Can I,
[01:18:36] Berridin: can I stand right here?
[01:18:45] Berridin: Bonus fire damage.
[01:18:47] GM: Yeah.
[01:18:48] GM: Imagine.
[01:18:49] Berridin: Okay.
[01:18:50] Berridin: Um,
[01:18:51] Berridin: I've never,
[01:18:51] Berridin: I've never,
[01:18:52] Berridin: I've never gone through this before with you,
[01:18:55] Berridin: Bobby,
[01:18:55] Berridin: but,
[01:18:56] Berridin: um,
[01:18:56] Berridin: this is,
[01:18:57] Berridin: this is the process through,
[01:18:58] Berridin: which I have my attacks.
[01:19:01] Berridin: Um,
[01:19:01] Berridin: I have,
[01:19:03] Berridin: um,
[01:19:05] Berridin: I,
[01:19:05] Berridin: these are both light weapons.
[01:19:07] GM: Mm-hmm.
[01:19:07] Berridin: Um,
[01:19:08] Berridin: so I,
[01:19:08] Berridin: I'm double,
[01:19:09] Berridin: double wielding,
[01:19:09] Berridin: uh,
[01:19:10] Berridin: two scimitars.
[01:19:11] GM: Mm-hmm.
[01:19:11] Berridin: Um,
[01:19:11] Berridin: they're both light weapons.
[01:19:12] Berridin: So that means I can attack,
[01:19:13] Berridin: uh,
[01:19:15] Berridin: once with,
[01:19:15] Berridin: uh,
[01:19:16] Berridin: my regular attack and then once with my bonus attack,
[01:19:18] Berridin: but I just use my bonus attack with,
[01:19:20] Berridin: for hex.
[01:19:21] Berridin: So I can't do that this turn.
[01:19:22] GM: Yeah.
[01:19:23] Berridin: Um,
[01:19:23] Berridin: but I have the,
[01:19:25] Berridin: I have the weapon mastery with scimitar,
[01:19:28] Berridin: from my barred subclass.
[01:19:29] GM: Mm-hmm.
[01:19:30] Berridin: That means I have the weapon mastery of Nick,
[01:19:33] Berridin: and that allows me to essentially turn that extra attack into like a,
[01:19:40] Berridin: into like a regular attack.
[01:19:41] Berridin: So I have,
[01:19:42] GM: So you can add the damage.
[01:19:44] GM: Because normally you couldn't add.
[01:19:45] Berridin: I,
[01:19:45] Berridin: I,
[01:19:46] GM: Yeah.
[01:19:47] Berridin: yeah,
[01:19:47] Berridin: yeah.
[01:19:47] Berridin: And I,
[01:19:48] Berridin: it's,
[01:19:48] Berridin: since it's,
[01:19:48] Berridin: uh,
[01:19:49] Berridin: since it's,
[01:19:49] Berridin: uh,
[01:19:50] Berridin: uh,
[01:19:50] Berridin: okay.
[01:19:51] Berridin: I'm just trying to double check out and make sure I know that working
[01:19:53] Berridin: Nick's Nick says,
[01:19:54] Berridin: when you make the extra attack of the light property,
[01:19:57] Berridin: you can make it as part of the attack action instead of as a bonus.
[01:20:01] Berridin: Action.
[01:20:02] Berridin: So typically,
[01:20:03] Berridin: um,
[01:20:03] Berridin: if I didn't cast my hex,
[01:20:05] Berridin: I would have three attacks with my scimitar.
[01:20:08] Berridin: Um,
[01:20:09] Berridin: since I casted my hex,
[01:20:11] Berridin: I only have two attacks with my scimitar.
[01:20:13] Berridin: Does that make sense?
[01:20:14] GM: Where is, I don't see your mastery though.
[01:20:19] Berridin: Yeah,
[01:20:19] Berridin: I know.
[01:20:19] Berridin: It's like,
[01:20:20] Berridin: it's not showing up.
[01:20:21] Berridin: It's supposed to show up when you hop,
[01:20:23] Berridin: when you hover over the weapon in my character sheet.
[01:20:26] Berridin: Um,
[01:20:27] Berridin: but right now the only thing you can see is this little red,
[01:20:30] GM: Red star.
[01:20:30] Berridin: this red star.
[01:20:31] GM: Yeah.
[01:20:31] Berridin: Yeah.
[01:20:32] GM: Oh, Nick on your, oh, okay.
[01:20:32] Berridin: And then you'll see in the note.
[01:20:34] GM: Yeah.
[01:20:34] Berridin: Yeah.
[01:20:34] Berridin: So there's,
[01:20:35] GM: There.
[01:20:35] Berridin: there's a few different properties that are intersecting here.
[01:20:36] GM: Yeah.
[01:20:38] Berridin: Sorry.
[01:20:38] Berridin: I'm just doing this all in my turn,
[01:20:40] GM: Yeah.
[01:20:40] Berridin: by the way,
[01:20:40] Berridin: but,
[01:20:40] Berridin: um,
[01:20:41] GM: No, it's fine.
[01:20:41] Berridin: it's,
[01:20:41] Berridin: it's a light attack property that is always exists for when you're
[01:20:46] Berridin: doing two handed.
[01:20:46] Berridin: So I'm doing a two,
[01:20:47] GM: Yeah, yeah.
[01:20:47] Berridin: two weapon,
[01:20:48] Berridin: two weapon fighting.
[01:20:49] Berridin: I have two weapon,
[01:20:50] Berridin: um,
[01:20:51] Berridin: fighting style.
[01:20:52] Berridin: So that,
[01:20:52] Berridin: that lets me add my,
[01:20:54] Berridin: uh,
[01:20:55] Berridin: my proficiency to my damage roles,
[01:20:57] Berridin: I think.
[01:20:58] Berridin: And then the Nick property is the mastery that lets me attack again,
[01:20:59] GM: It's only like property.
[01:21:03] Berridin: basically.
[01:21:03] Berridin: So when I'm,
[01:21:04] Berridin: when I'm maxed out as this character,
[01:21:07] Berridin: I should have like four,
[01:21:08] Berridin: four attacks.
[01:21:13] GM: You can make it as part of the attack instead of bonus.
[01:21:16] GM: Only once per turn.
[01:21:20] Berridin: Yeah.
[01:21:20] Berridin: So that's,
[01:21:21] GM: Okay.
[01:21:21] Berridin: that's traditionally.
[01:21:22] Berridin: So traditionally you would only have three,
[01:21:24] Berridin: like one,
[01:21:25] Berridin: once you,
[01:21:25] Berridin: you would have essentially like another attack.
[01:21:27] Berridin: Like you,
[01:21:27] Berridin: you attack once with your main hand and then once with your bonus
[01:21:30] Berridin: attack,
[01:21:31] GM: Well, it's like when melee characters get that,
[01:21:31] Berridin: the Nick,
[01:21:32] Berridin: the Nick prop mastery moves that bonus attack to like a weird,
[01:21:36] Berridin: like non bonus attack.
[01:21:41] GM: at level five or whatever.
[01:21:42] Berridin: Yeah.
[01:21:43] GM: Oh, okay, okay, okay.
[01:21:44] Berridin: Yeah.
[01:21:45] Berridin: Yeah.
[01:21:46] GM: So yeah, you can, that means with Nick,
[01:21:49] GM: do two attack rolls.
[01:21:51] Berridin: Two attacks.
[01:21:51] Berridin: Yeah.
[01:21:52] Berridin: This essentially it's it's it's I think it's there was a way to make two
[01:21:55] Berridin: weapon fighting a little bit better in the new edition.
[01:21:59] Berridin: So it's a little bit,
[01:22:00] Berridin: it's a little bit catch up cause I it's low damage,
[01:22:02] Berridin: but it can do it.
[01:22:03] Berridin: So what I'm,
[01:22:04] Berridin: what essentially I'm trying to do is I'm trying to stack the hex damage
[01:22:07] Berridin: with as many weapon attacks as I can muster in a single turn.
[01:22:12] GM: Yeah, cool, cool.
[01:22:12] Berridin: Um,
[01:22:13] GM: Yeah, so roll to attack.
[01:22:13] Berridin: okay.
[01:22:15] Berridin: Okay.
[01:22:15] Berridin: Perfect.
[01:22:16] Berridin: And then the last thing I apologize for so many things,
[01:22:19] GM: That's fine.
[01:22:19] Berridin: if I make a successful attack,
[01:22:21] Berridin: then I can use my bard,
[01:22:23] Berridin: my sword barred like spells.
[01:22:25] Berridin: I can use my bardic inspiration to add whatever flourish that I want.
[01:22:32] Berridin: Like I have the defensive flourish,
[01:22:33] GM: Yeah.
[01:22:33] Berridin: mobile portion sounds.
[01:22:34] Berridin: Okay.
[01:22:34] Berridin: Thank you.
[01:22:35] GM: Yeah.
[01:22:35] Berridin: Thanks.
[01:22:35] Berridin: Sorry.
[01:22:35] Berridin: Sorry.
[01:22:36] GM: And I mean, you're just consuming your bardic
[01:22:36] Berridin: I know there's a lot.
[01:22:40] GM: inspiration for that.
[01:22:41] GM: So just make sure you keep track of them,
[01:22:44] Berridin: Yes.
[01:22:44] Berridin: Yeah.
[01:22:45] Berridin: I'm keeping track of everything.
[01:22:46] GM: because you only have three.
[01:22:46] Berridin: Okay.
[01:22:48] GM: Yeah.
[01:22:49] Berridin: Perfect.
[01:22:49] Berridin: Okay.
[01:22:50] Berridin: So I have similar to,
[01:22:51] Berridin: I'll do my first attack for the seminar.
[01:22:55] GM: Oh, OK.
[01:22:57] Berridin: It's a 14.
[01:22:59] GM: 14 does not hit.
[01:23:00] Berridin: Shit.
[01:23:01] Nyx: That's what I got, too.
[01:23:01] Berridin: Okay.
[01:23:02] Nyx: I also got a 14.
[01:23:03] Berridin: Then,
[01:23:04] Berridin: uh,
[01:23:08] Berridin: Oh,
[01:23:08] Berridin: my flourishes doesn't matter.
[01:23:09] Berridin: I don't have to hit them.
[01:23:10] Berridin: Right.
[01:23:11] Berridin: I can still,
[01:23:12] GM: Hold on.
[01:23:13] Berridin: Oh no,
[01:23:14] Berridin: I have to,
[01:23:15] GM: Yeah, usually Flourish has to hit.
[01:23:15] Berridin: I have to hit them.
[01:23:16] Berridin: Nevermind.
[01:23:17] Berridin: I have to hit.
[01:23:17] Berridin: Nevermind.
[01:23:18] Berridin: Nevermind.
[01:23:19] Berridin: It might,
[01:23:19] Berridin: my walking speed increases no matter what,
[01:23:21] Berridin: but,
[01:23:22] GM: Hm.
[01:23:22] Berridin: um,
[01:23:22] Berridin: I have to hit them.
[01:23:23] Berridin: Okay.
[01:23:23] Berridin: I'll,
[01:23:24] Berridin: I'm going to go for the second stack here.
[01:23:26] GM: Yeah.
[01:23:28] Berridin: I got a 14 again.
[01:23:29] GM: Yeah, does not hit.
[01:23:31] GM: Cool, cool, cool.
[01:23:31] Berridin: Cool.
[01:23:34] GM: Cool, so Ellara's turn?
[01:23:36] Berridin: Yep.
[01:23:37] GM: Ellara.
[01:23:37] Berridin: I'm putting this here.
[01:23:41] GM: Yeah.
[01:23:41] Ellara: disadvantage right for rain like a spell would be ranged though oh um wait what is this and a failed
[01:23:45] GM: For any range?
[01:23:50] GM: Well, not really, if you do touch.
[01:23:52] GM: Some spells are touch.
[01:23:54] GM: If it's a pew, pew, pew spell, yeah.
[01:23:58] GM: It depends on if it's a range.
[01:24:00] GM: Because some spells are like a touch spell,
[01:24:02] GM: like Chilling Touch or Chilling Grasp or whatever.
[01:24:04] GM: It's touch, right?
[01:24:05] GM: So you have to be in melee range.
[01:24:14] GM: It really depends on what spell you're using.
[01:24:20] Ysidor: yay
[01:24:23] GM: Oh.
[01:24:27] GM: Yeah.
[01:24:30] Ellara: save and on yeah yeah yeah or guiding bolt or something okay so then i will
[01:24:32] GM: And obviously, like, something that stuff like Fireball
[01:24:37] GM: or like Aerial Effects don't really apply,
[01:24:40] GM: it's really single target range spells.
[01:24:43] GM: So like if you're doing Scorching Ray.
[01:24:47] GM: Yeah.
[01:24:50] Ellara: just here's the size how do i draw the circles here it's five foot if it says area five feet
[01:25:05] Ellara: that's the diameter or the radius a moon beam okay it didn't finish me okay so she'll just
[01:25:07] GM: What spell?
[01:25:08] GM: It's usually Radius, I believe.
[01:25:12] GM: Oh, Moonbeam, yeah, that's 5 feet.
[01:25:16] GM: Yeah, Area is, well, it will say to Cylinder,
[01:25:19] GM: drops down 5 foot radius.
[01:25:20] GM: Yeah, it's a 5 foot radius.
[01:25:22] GM: The description says the radius.
[01:25:26] Ellara: drop a moon beam here uh constitution yes so 2d 10 2d 10 uh i guess i could i should roll that
[01:25:32] GM: And what is the save for Moonbeam?
[01:25:37] GM: Con save, cool, cool, cool, cool.
[01:25:42] GM: Hey, OK.
[01:25:44] GM: Con save, saving throw, Constitution, just roll.
[01:25:52] GM: I got an 8.
[01:25:53] GM: I probably take full damage.
[01:25:57] Nyx: Moonbeam.
[01:25:59] GM: How much damage?
[01:26:02] GM: Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:26:04] GM: You roll your damage.
[01:26:04] Ellara: yeah nine nine and just in case they were polymorphed or something they lose that but
[01:26:07] GM: I'm not going to roll it.
[01:26:08] GM: Can't accuse me of anything.
[01:26:10] GM: 9.
[01:26:16] GM: Oh, yeah, no, all of that was gone.
[01:26:16] Ellara: i don't think that matters um yeah bonus action no i don't have anything to do with for bonus action
[01:26:20] GM: They drop that in a ..
[01:26:24] Berridin: The battlefield is very symmetrical right now.
[01:26:26] Berridin: I kind of like it.
[01:26:29] GM: So you have bonus action and movement.
[01:26:47] Ellara: no because i'll trigger an attack good wait no no no no like he has two he has two divine smites
[01:26:48] GM: Will you move?
[01:26:53] GM: Oh, you don't want an opportunity attack from me?
[01:26:59] GM: Witty, it's your turn.
[01:27:02] GM: Feel free to ask all the questions you want.
[01:27:05] GM: I realize it's the first time.
[01:27:10] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: i don't know if we've really even talked about this either but like um you know my my spells are
[01:27:15] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: kind of like i have little like uh tiny like grenades right that kind of have like gases in
[01:27:21] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: them or something um so like for like if i wanted to you know cast grease for instance like i could
[01:27:28] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: throw a little like grenade there that explodes and then like the gas spreads out and then like
[01:27:33] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: turns into grease falling to the ground something like that can i describe my my spells like that
[01:27:40] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: if it works yeah yeah yeah i'm using exactly the same yeah i'm just saying this is how i would
[01:27:44] GM: This is based off of.
[01:27:47] Berridin: It's just like a flavor.
[01:27:48] Berridin: Thing,
[01:27:48] Berridin: Matt.
[01:27:49] Berridin: Like,
[01:27:49] Berridin: um,
[01:27:50] Berridin: so it's like,
[01:27:51] Berridin: you're still using spell slots,
[01:27:52] Berridin: but you're saying that it's yeah.
[01:27:55] GM: Oh, oh, yeah, OK, thank you for the clarity.
[01:27:55] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: describe how i would cast something yeah yeah oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i was just
[01:27:57] Berridin: Yeah.
[01:28:00] GM: Yes, sorry, I thought it was like an art,
[01:28:03] GM: because you're an artifice or two.
[01:28:04] GM: I was like, wait, is this like magical items?
[01:28:08] GM: Because, like, that's.
[01:28:10] GM: Oh, yeah, the 2025, 2024 artificers
[01:28:15] GM: can make common magical items.
[01:28:17] GM: Anyways, point being, yeah, you can use it.
[01:28:22] GM: Same rules apply.
[01:28:23] GM: 10-foot squared centered on a point within range.
[01:28:28] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: using that as an example um okay cool because uh i think what i want to do though is like since i'm
[01:28:29] GM: Yeah, OK, so you will have to roll an attack roll.
[01:28:36] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: like kneeling by the fire and kind of like catching all this happening out of the side of my eye i'm
[01:28:42] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: just going to like pull it off and just like kind of like um i'm just going to turn it into my uh it's like a green ball that i have hanging on my uh hip and i pull it off and i'm gonna uh roll it at to the feet of the um bandit deceiver um and it's gonna uh you know explode and put them in a in a a cloud of green dust for ray of sickness
[01:29:11] GM: If you click on the plus 5, yeah, so in your character sheet,
[01:29:11] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: mm-hmm it says arrange spell attack
[01:29:14] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: where do i do i what do i do i like to do that
[01:29:17] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: i click on uh-huh yep uh-huh oh cool so 13 yeah okay um and so now i can do movement
[01:29:19] GM: you see.
[01:29:20] GM: Yeah.
[01:29:20] GM: Ray of sickness.
[01:29:21] GM: You can do cast to use it.
[01:29:23] GM: You see the plus 5.
[01:29:24] GM: If you click on the plus 5, it'll auto-roll the attack for you.
[01:29:28] Berridin: Yeah.
[01:29:30] GM: 13 misses.
[01:29:32] GM: You'll still consume the spell slot,
[01:29:34] GM: so you have to check off the spell slot on the top.
[01:29:37] GM: It misses.
[01:29:38] GM: Yes, you can move, and you're outside of 5 feet,
[01:29:45] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: okay okay um i don't think i have really a bonus action that'll work right now
[01:29:49] GM: so you don't do opportunity attack,
[01:29:51] GM: and you still have a bonus action.
[01:29:57] GM: Yeah, probably not.

[01:30:52] GM: I don't have any.
[01:31:03] Ysidor: um not i don't think so i try it's it's i don't think i think it's just like i activate it
[01:31:06] GM: Doesn't it consume an action?
[01:31:12] GM: Let me double.
[01:31:16] Ysidor: let me see yeah i'd google the same thing it's not it's not clear um well i i as their actions
[01:31:30] Berridin: I'm also reading all of your guys's like spell sheets.
[01:31:34] GM: Yeah, that's fair.
[01:31:35] GM: I do it all the time.
[01:31:36] GM: You take the oath of the game the following to loving embrace.
[01:31:38] GM: You take the oath of the game the following to loving embrace.
[01:31:39] GM: You take the oath of the game the following to loving embrace.
[01:31:40] GM: You take the oath of the game the following to loving embrace.
[01:31:41] GM: You take the oath of the game the following to loving embrace.
[01:31:45] GM: You take the oath of the game the following to loving embrace.
[01:31:46] GM: Channel , action?
[01:31:55] GM: Oh, it's the abilities themselves.
[01:31:59] GM: It depends on what the ability is.
[01:32:02] GM: Yeah, so loving embraces as an action,
[01:32:04] GM: and then galvanize affection is an action.
[01:32:05] Ysidor: yeah
[01:32:08] GM: So it's what, in their description.
[01:32:10] GM: And it consumes the, yeah.
[01:32:11] Ysidor: i thought i thought it was like a bonus action or something at most okay never mind scratch by just
[01:32:14] GM: Now they're both actions.
[01:32:17] Ysidor: what i was about to do no it's not a bonus it's not a bonus action it's an action yeah there was
[01:32:18] Berridin: That's good though.
[01:32:19] Berridin: Isn't that,
[01:32:20] Berridin: doesn't it make it easier for you?
[01:32:21] Berridin: Cause you don't have to waste action on it.
[01:32:28] Berridin: Oh,
[01:32:28] Berridin: Oh,
[01:32:29] Ysidor: action so like before a fight would be great but not during um so we'll do a good old just a regular
[01:32:29] Berridin: it's actually okay.
[01:32:30] GM: Yeah.
[01:32:30] Berridin: Sorry.
[01:32:30] Berridin: Sorry.
[01:32:30] Berridin: Okay.
[01:32:30] Berridin: Okay.
[01:32:31] GM: yeah 24 does hit um one if it's a thrown weapon um so if you throw uh where sorry i
[01:32:31] Berridin: My,
[01:32:38] Ysidor: attack uh does a 24 hit and what am i sorry what i have two
[01:32:47] Berridin: my holy shit.
[01:32:53] Ysidor: here one second
[01:32:56] Ysidor: i like two different roles for some reason
[01:33:04] Ysidor: the one what
[01:33:06] Ysidor: okay
[01:33:09] GM: know but for damage he has two different damage rolls um the second damage roll uh
[01:33:11] Ellara: oh you do no no
[01:33:13] Ysidor: yeah but the hindsight
[01:33:14] Ysidor: was
[01:33:19] GM: wait wait hold on thrown versus oh it's because it's versatile once two-handed versus one-handed
[01:33:21] Ysidor: the debate higher if i threw it that doesn't make sense to me
[01:33:30] GM: so if it's two-handed you don't have a shield right yeah so one-handed so you do slightly
[01:33:34] Ysidor: oh wait i think i do have it wait one second i do not remember if i have a shield equipped
[01:33:38] Ysidor: give me one second
[01:33:38] Berridin: I see.
[01:33:39] Berridin: And you do have a shield.
[01:33:40] Ysidor: that makes sense yeah i do never mind okay so
[01:33:44] GM: less damage that's the difference you're doing a trident or your war pick yeah so it's 1d10
[01:33:47] Ysidor: okay
[01:33:48] Ysidor: no no my war pick
[01:33:51] GM: two-handed 1d8 uh one-handed okay so roll your damage
[01:33:55] Ysidor: okay i'm gonna do that and plus with the the bad attack i'm adding a divine smite
[01:34:05] GM: oh damn just one attack roll what's the duration okay so just one of the attack rolls cool
[01:34:06] Ysidor: and then i will divine smite so 19 points of damage
[01:34:17] Berridin: Dang.
[01:34:17] Berridin: He also has SAP on that war pick.
[01:34:20] Ysidor: yeah so uh next role uh will be a disadvantage uh wait it's that yeah the next uh the bandits
[01:34:20] Berridin: Yes.
[01:34:20] Berridin: That there's that mastery before.
[01:34:29] Ysidor: next attack role will be in disadvantage uh on eighth next attack roll yeah
[01:34:37] Berridin: Yeah.
[01:34:40] Ysidor: yeah it hurts
[01:34:41] GM: bandit's turn a little tougher than you thought than i thought um oh this is interesting uh
[01:34:53] GM: you gotta look to lara uh no it's like uh the hair is kind of the same so she didn't
[01:34:57] Berridin: Bobby does,
[01:34:57] Berridin: does she,
[01:34:57] Berridin: does she still look like she does to us at the start?
[01:35:00] Berridin: Or is she completely different?
[01:35:03] Ellara: is she a woman check no no yeah well i am down you probably should have used hunter's mark as a
[01:35:05] GM: do like it was very like in the sense of like she didn't completely change what she looked
[01:35:11] GM: like right like she just made herself look like a common i'm a young woman
[01:35:12] Berridin: Yeah.
[01:35:16] GM: now she's kind of her her clothing a bit more skin tight you can see weapons um the face is
[01:35:23] GM: pretty much the same i don't know that that's your question okay so the first attack roll
[01:35:25] Berridin: Is,
[01:35:25] Berridin: is witty and didn't like still sexually attracted to her.
[01:35:37] Nyx: That's bad.
[01:35:42] GM: will be with disadvantage um a 12 does a 12 hit a lara um i have three attacks uh so it's just
[01:35:52] GM: attack roll right i have three attack rolls okay well this is gonna roll flat
[01:35:57] Berridin: I think it's just one from what it says.
[01:35:58] Berridin: It says if you hit a creature with a war pick that creature has
[01:36:01] Berridin: disadvantage on its next attack role before the start of your next turn.
[01:36:09] GM: does a nine hit no does a 16 hit uh seven points of damage plus uh wait oh um 24 points of damage
[01:36:27] GM: seven points of piercing uh 17 points of poison damage um concentrations broke so moonbeam's gone
[01:36:34] Nyx: Shit.
[01:36:37] GM: gotta love that moonbeam's good uh it hurts um she goes ah yeah take out the scrawny one first
[01:36:40] Berridin: What does Moomdean do again?
[01:36:44] Nyx: Kill everything.
[01:36:47] Ysidor: i think you should
[01:36:54] GM: before i deal with tin can over there um cool
[01:36:59] GM: cool um she's not gonna move because well um yeah because attacks of opportunity
[01:37:11] GM: um let me double check she doesn't have bonus actions at all
[01:37:16] GM: um
[01:37:26] GM: Okay.
[01:37:35] Nyx: I'm here.
[01:37:35] GM: She wanted to get rid of that.
[01:37:36] GM: Okay, end of her turn. She's not moving.
[01:37:39] GM: Nyx, your turn.
[01:37:41] Nyx: I've been here the whole time.
[01:37:43] GM: No, you haven't been. Don't lie to me.
[01:37:44] Nyx: Right.
[01:37:45] Nyx: Right out of range.
[01:37:47] Nyx: Right out of range of the camera.
[01:37:48] Nyx: All right.
[01:37:49] Nyx: So I am going to do what I tried to do last time.
[01:37:52] Nyx: Okay.
[01:37:52] Nyx: So let me just...
[01:37:54] Nyx: I'm going to attack with my crossbow.
[01:37:56] Nyx: I've got 30 feet of range, and I'm 15 feet away from her.
[01:37:59] Nyx: I did the thing already.
[01:38:00] GM: Yeah.
[01:38:01] GM: I trust you.
[01:38:02] Nyx: Yeah.
[01:38:03] Nyx: I'm going to...
[01:38:03] Nyx: Let's do that, and then I'll...
[01:38:05] Nyx: Let me hit...
[01:38:06] Nyx: See if I hit.
[01:38:08] Nyx: Does a 25 hit?
[01:38:11] GM: A 25 does hit.
[01:38:13] Nyx: Oh, yeah.
[01:38:14] Nyx: All right.
[01:38:15] Nyx: Revenge.
[01:38:16] Nyx: So I'm going to do that dreadful...
[01:38:18] Nyx: Dreadful strike, and then...
[01:38:22] Nyx: And vex, but vex is automatic.
[01:38:27] Nyx: So what do I do?
[01:38:29] Nyx: How do I do this?
[01:38:30] Nyx: It's an extra 2d psychic.
[01:38:31] GM: Your character should.
[01:38:32] Nyx: So let me...
[01:38:34] Nyx: Does it do it automatically?
[01:38:36] Nyx: Did it add...
[01:38:38] Nyx: I don't know if it added it.
[01:38:39] Nyx: I don't think so.
[01:38:40] Nyx: Oh, I have to do dreadful strike separately.
[01:38:42] Nyx: Okay.
[01:38:43] Nyx: I see.
[01:38:43] Nyx: Okay.
[01:38:44] Nyx: So I'm going for damage for the crossbow.
[01:38:46] Nyx: Sorry.
[01:38:47] Nyx: This is the first time I've done this.
[01:38:48] Nyx: It's been a while.
[01:38:48] GM: Yeah, it's okay.
[01:38:50] Berridin: It's really interesting.
[01:38:51] Berridin: Interesting.
[01:38:52] Nyx: God damn it.
[01:38:54] Nyx: Four points of damage.
[01:38:55] Nyx: Okay.
[01:38:56] Nyx: And then dreadful strike.
[01:38:56] GM: Loving it.
[01:39:00] Nyx: Seven points of damage.
[01:39:02] GM: You rolled a...
[01:39:03] GM: Oh yeah, you rolled horribly.
[01:39:05] GM: So that's 11 points of damage.
[01:39:08] Nyx: Yeah.
[01:39:11] GM: Anything else?
[01:39:12] Nyx: That was really bad.
[01:39:15] Nyx: And I...
[01:39:17] Nyx: But I...
[01:39:18] Nyx: Yeah, and I have advantage on my next attack roll against a creature before the end of my next turn.
[01:39:24] Nyx: Okay.
[01:39:24] Berridin: But does that,
[01:39:25] Berridin: does that work?
[01:39:26] Berridin: Like if you,
[01:39:27] Berridin: if you only attack once during your turn?
[01:39:30] Nyx: It's if I hit the creature.
[01:39:30] GM: Yeah.
[01:39:31] Nyx: If I hit the creature.
[01:39:31] GM: It works because the end of his turn...
[01:39:35] GM: So he...
[01:39:36] GM: At the beginning of his next turn, he can do an attack, right?
[01:39:40] GM: So it will be
[01:39:41] GM: still in effect
[01:39:42] GM: when his turn comes up next.
[01:39:44] Nyx: Yeah.
[01:39:44] Berridin: Oh,
[01:39:45] GM: It's after his turn.
[01:39:45] Berridin: okay.
[01:39:45] Berridin: Can you,
[01:39:46] Berridin: can you like,
[01:39:47] Nyx: Yeah.
[01:39:47] Berridin: can you,
[01:39:48] Berridin: can you dual wield hand crossbows?
[01:39:50] Nyx: You...
[01:39:50] Berridin: Okay.
[01:39:51] Nyx: I think I can.
[01:39:52] GM: You can, but
[01:39:53] GM: you wouldn't add your bonus
[01:39:55] GM: to the damage on the second one
[01:39:57] GM: if they're both light.
[01:39:58] GM: Unless you have, like,
[01:39:59] GM: Mastery and all that, right?
[01:40:01] GM: That's kind of like...
[01:40:01] Berridin: Okay.
[01:40:01] Berridin: Okay.
[01:40:02] Nyx: Which is where I'm going, but...
[01:40:02] Berridin: Good.
[01:40:02] Berridin: Yeah.
[01:40:04] Nyx: Not...
[01:40:04] Berridin: No.
[01:40:04] Berridin: Yeah.
[01:40:04] Berridin: That seems really useful.
[01:40:05] Nyx: I forgot.
[01:40:06] GM: Yeah.
[01:40:06] Berridin: Cause if you do have dual then,
[01:40:10] Ellara: bonus action yes yeah and there's some advantage stuff but like if they try to hide that one's
[01:40:12] Nyx: Can I cast it even though I've already attacked?
[01:40:13] Berridin: Oh yeah.
[01:40:15] Nyx: Can I do bonus...
[01:40:16] Nyx: Is it a bonus action?
[01:40:18] GM: Yeah.
[01:40:18] Berridin: It's a bonus action.
[01:40:19] Nyx: I can, actually.
[01:40:19] GM: Yeah.
[01:40:21] Nyx: All right.
[01:40:21] Nyx: I will cast Hunter's Mark.
[01:40:21] GM: Yeah.
[01:40:21] Berridin: Yeah.
[01:40:23] Nyx: I know, but I've already...
[01:40:25] Nyx: Be fair.
[01:40:26] Nyx: I already attacked.
[01:40:27] Nyx: But I will throw Caster's Mark on top of that.
[01:40:30] Nyx: And I do...
[01:40:30] GM: Undersmark.
[01:40:31] GM: Okay, and what's...
[01:40:32] GM: I have to look that up again.
[01:40:35] Nyx: I do have that under bonus action.
[01:40:36] Berridin: It's a damage one D six,
[01:40:38] Berridin: right?
[01:40:39] Nyx: No.
[01:40:40] Nyx: Is it actually damage?
[01:40:42] Nyx: Oh, it is damage.
[01:40:42] Berridin: Yeah.
[01:40:42] Berridin: That's,
[01:40:43] Nyx: Yeah.
[01:40:43] Berridin: that's the only like good thing about Rangers.
[01:40:45] Berridin: I thought.
[01:40:46] Nyx: Yeah.
[01:40:47] Nyx: And it's a bonus action.
[01:40:51] GM: Yeah, there's, like,
[01:40:51] GM: yeah, wisdom stuff.
[01:40:51] Berridin: Yeah.
[01:40:54] Nyx: Okay.
[01:40:54] GM: Yeah, you'll have.
[01:40:55] Nyx: So I will all roll, I guess, for Hunter's Mark.
[01:40:58] Nyx: Thank you.
[01:40:59] GM: I mean, technically,
[01:41:01] GM: you did it in the wrong order,
[01:41:02] GM: but I'm not going to be an asshole.
[01:41:03] Nyx: Oh, thank you.
[01:41:05] Nyx: Thank you.
[01:41:06] Nyx: That's a three.
[01:41:06] Berridin: Rules as written rules as written.
[01:41:08] GM: Rules as written.
[01:41:10] Ysidor: what do you
[01:41:11] GM: Yeah, okay.
[01:41:13] Nyx: So an extra three.
[01:41:13] GM: I'll put green.
[01:41:15] GM: Yeah.
[01:41:15] GM: Yeah.
[01:41:16] GM: Yeah.
[01:41:17] GM: Um, any, uh, movement.
[01:41:19] Nyx: I stay hidden at this point.
[01:41:21] Nyx: I duck back down.
[01:41:21] GM: Yep.
[01:41:22] GM: Uh,
[01:41:23] GM: do-do-do-do-do.
[01:41:24] GM: And, Matt, just for your reference,
[01:41:26] GM: yeah, combat gets long.
[01:41:27] GM: I help facilitate it,
[01:41:29] GM: so I'll be like,
[01:41:29] GM: your action, your bonus action.
[01:41:31] Nyx: You did this wrong.
[01:41:31] GM: Uh, if I'm smart,
[01:41:32] GM: I tell you when your turn's
[01:41:34] GM: going to be next.
[01:41:35] GM: So Baradun's,
[01:41:36] GM: Din's next with
[01:41:37] GM: Alar doing a death save after.
[01:41:39] GM: Uh, Din.
[01:41:40] GM: Well, it's because you're casting,
[01:41:41] Berridin: We,
[01:41:41] Berridin: we used to be so much slower and like,
[01:41:44] Berridin: now we're like marginally a bit faster now.
[01:41:46] Nyx: Wait.
[01:41:46] Ysidor: oh yeah there's like yeah
[01:41:47] Nyx: Hang on.
[01:41:48] GM: you're casting less spells,
[01:41:50] Nyx: We are...
[01:41:50] Nyx: We are...
[01:41:50] Nyx: We're also level, what, three?
[01:41:50] GM: mostly.
[01:41:53] Nyx: Like, we...
[01:41:53] GM: Yeah.
[01:41:54] Nyx: Yeah.
[01:41:54] Nyx: I had, like, 25 spells to pick from each time.
[01:41:54] Berridin: Yeah.
[01:41:58] Nyx: Like, at the end.
[01:41:59] Nyx: Last campaign.
[01:42:00] Nyx: Yeah.
[01:42:00] Nyx: Bobby's right.
[01:42:00] Berridin: I,
[01:42:01] Berridin: I think Mark's turns were the funniest last campaign.
[01:42:04] Berridin: Cause I,
[01:42:04] Berridin: we would have to roll 20 different things to get his little bonus.
[01:42:07] GM: And then Mark's like,
[01:42:08] GM: I shoot,
[01:42:09] GM: but when Mark went
[01:42:09] Berridin: That was crazy.
[01:42:11] Nyx: Yeah.
[01:42:12] GM: on top of the turn,
[01:42:14] GM: he had assassinate.
[01:42:15] Ysidor: yeah well the the fight with the dragon where we had a surprise round and all my all my hits were
[01:42:15] GM: Fucking wrecked.
[01:42:17] GM: When Mark hit,
[01:42:17] GM: he wrecked shit.
[01:42:18] GM: It's just,
[01:42:19] GM: when he didn't,
[01:42:20] GM: he was like,
[01:42:20] GM: I'm going to roll my attack.
[01:42:29] Ysidor: critical so it was like four quick dice that did like a hundred points of damage was like ridiculous
[01:42:32] Nyx: Yep.
[01:42:36] Nyx: Yep.
[01:42:36] GM: So, uh,
[01:42:37] GM: Matt, for context,
[01:42:38] GM: when you roll a nat 20
[01:42:40] GM: on an attack,
[01:42:41] GM: hit all your dice rolls
[01:42:42] GM: for damage
[01:42:43] GM: or you rolled twice
[01:42:44] GM: the amount of dice.
[01:42:46] GM: The modifiers are the same,

[01:42:48] GM: But if it's 2d6,
[01:42:50] GM: that becomes,
[01:42:50] GM: that's 4d6.
[01:42:52] GM: And because he had,

[01:46:51] GM: Well,
[01:46:51] GM: you could use an action
[01:46:52] GM: to take
[01:46:53] GM: and move,
[01:46:55] GM: and then you have
[01:46:56] GM: your bonus action.

[01:48:09] GM: Yeah.
[01:48:10] GM: It's easier just to describe it as spell slots.

[01:54:04] GM: Yeah.
[01:54:05] GM: I've been doing it for her thing.
[01:54:06] GM: So,
[01:54:07] GM: Don't worry.
[01:54:09] GM: Yeah, do you want to move?
[01:54:13] GM: OK, so they look at all of you.
[01:54:17] GM: They're kind of, hmm, I guess we're going to, let's see,
[01:54:24] GM: circle, wait, how big, 10 feet?
[01:54:33] GM: Yeah, can they, let's, yeah, so Din's the only one not
[01:54:41] GM: getting hit by this.
[01:54:45] GM: Witty, Nyx, Ysidor, Ellara, all roll a constitution saving
[01:54:53] GM: throw, DC 14.
[01:54:58] Ysidor: assuming oh no it's like it's uh not of course nat 20 on this one can i head back
[01:54:59] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: At 23?
[01:55:02] GM: OK, 23.
[01:55:05] Nyx: Oh, my god.
[01:55:07] Nyx: I got a five.
[01:55:08] Nyx: What the fuck?
[01:55:12] Ysidor: if you like i am okay just this one oh one second did you roll was it an attack roll
[01:55:15] GM: On Nyx and Ellara, 11 points of damage.
[01:55:19] GM: You're both blinded until the start of the next bandits turn.
[01:55:27] GM: And for the rest of you, that's 5 points
[01:55:30] GM: of damage.
[01:55:31] GM: So Witty, 5 points of damage.
[01:55:34] GM: Ysidor, 5 points of damage.
[01:55:36] Nyx: What...
[01:55:36] Nyx: What does blind do again?
[01:55:39] Nyx: Mechanical.
[01:55:39] GM: Blinded means you can't see.
[01:55:41] GM: So anything that requires sight, you failed.
[01:55:44] GM: Attacks against you have advantage.
[01:55:46] GM: You have disadvantage on attacks.
[01:55:50] Nyx: Okay.
[01:55:51] Nyx: But I can still attack.
[01:55:53] GM: You can still attack, but just think
[01:55:56] GM: attacking with a blindfold.
[01:56:00] Nyx: I'm just saying, is it an auto fail or is it disadvantage?
[01:56:03] GM: No, no, you can still attack.
[01:56:04] Nyx: Got it.
[01:56:05] GM: You're just disadvantage.
[01:56:07] Nyx: With my advantage.
[01:56:08] GM: OK.
[01:56:09] Nyx: So it just cancels out.
[01:56:11] GM: Oh, you have advantage?
[01:56:14] GM: I got rid of my circle.
[01:56:15] GM: I was just seeing.
[01:56:16] Nyx: No, I have advantage in my next turn because...
[01:56:21] Nyx: It's a flashbang.
[01:56:21] Ysidor: by the way okay no i'm just asking yeah it doesn't just say i was yeah
[01:56:23] GM: No.
[01:56:30] GM: Basically, she, basically, it doesn't even say what it,
[01:56:38] GM: do you see it's using?
[01:56:39] GM: I guess it's like, it's some kind of like spell thing.
[01:56:42] GM: Anyway, it's kind of like a fireball,
[01:56:43] GM: but it's blinding flash.
[01:56:45] GM: It's basically, what you saw is they threw something up
[01:56:49] GM: in the air.
[01:56:49] GM: It exploded.
[01:56:50] GM: It exploded.
[01:56:50] GM: It's blinding two of you.
[01:56:53] Nyx: Okay.
[01:56:54] GM: Yeah.
[01:56:56] GM: Yeah, so that's their turn.
[01:56:56] Berridin: Nice.
[01:56:57] Berridin: Okay.
[01:57:01] GM: They're kind of stuck between Ysidor and Din,
[01:57:03] GM: so they're not going to move.
[01:57:09] GM: Nyx, it's your turn.
[01:57:10] Nyx: Yeah.
[01:57:11] Nyx: So as I was saying before, when I cast Hunter's Mark...
[01:57:17] Nyx: No, not Hunter's Mark.
[01:57:19] Nyx: It was Vex.
[01:57:21] Nyx: So I'm going to read Vex again.
[01:57:23] Nyx: If you hit...
[01:57:24] Nyx: It's from last turn.
[01:57:25] Nyx: If you hit a creature with a hand...
[01:57:27] Nyx: Hand crossbow and deal damage to it, which I did, you have advantage on your next attack
[01:57:33] Nyx: roll against the creature before the end of your next turn.
[01:57:37] Nyx: So according to what you said, correct me if I'm wrong, so I have advantage right now
[01:57:42] Nyx: for my attack.
[01:57:43] GM: Yeah.
[01:57:44] Nyx: And I also have disadvantage.
[01:57:46] Nyx: So what happens?
[01:57:46] GM: Yeah, so you roll flat.
[01:57:47] Nyx: Flat.
[01:57:48] Nyx: Okay.
[01:57:48] Nyx: Cool.
[01:57:49] Nyx: All right.
[01:57:49] Nyx: I'm going to do that.
[01:57:50] Nyx: I'm going to attack with my crossbow.
[01:57:54] Nyx: Um...
[01:57:54] Nyx: And...
[01:57:56] Nyx: I'm going...
[01:57:57] Nyx: I'm going to...
[01:57:57] Nyx: Uh...
[01:57:58] Nyx: Yeah.
[01:57:59] Nyx: I'm just going to roll flat.
[01:57:59] Berridin: Sorry.
[01:58:00] Nyx: I'm not going to...
[01:58:00] Nyx: What?
[01:58:00] GM: Where did the second Nyx come from?
[01:58:01] Berridin: Sorry.
[01:58:04] GM: Also, there's a Nyx.
[01:58:04] Berridin: I'm sorry.
[01:58:05] Berridin: That was me.
[01:58:06] Berridin: It was my fault.
[01:58:07] Berridin: My fault.
[01:58:07] Berridin: I'm sorry.
[01:58:09] Berridin: Sorry.
[01:58:10] Nyx: Oh my god.
[01:58:11] Nyx: Wait.
[01:58:12] Nyx: Let me look at the map.
[01:58:12] GM: Nyx's twin Twix.
[01:58:12] Berridin: Sorry.
[01:58:12] Berridin: Sorry.
[01:58:14] Nyx: There you go.
[01:58:16] Nyx: Um...
[01:58:16] Nyx: I don't have that skill yet.
[01:58:18] Nyx: I can't...
[01:58:18] Nyx: I don't have doppelganger or whatever.
[01:58:20] Nyx: It's...
[01:58:21] Nyx: I don't even think I can do that.
[01:58:22] Nyx: But anyways.
[01:58:23] Nyx: Um...
[01:58:23] Nyx: Let me roll.
[01:58:29] Nyx: There's a 26 hit.
[01:58:31] GM: A 26 hits.
[01:58:33] Berridin: Nice.
[01:58:39] Nyx: Nine points of damage.

[01:58:47] Nyx: Well, so...
[01:58:48] Nyx: So...
[01:58:49] Nyx: Pause.

[01:58:50] Nyx: So I want to be fair.
[01:58:52] Nyx: Like...
[01:58:52] Nyx: I could use Hunter's Mark as a bonus action.
[01:58:57] Nyx: Um...
[01:58:57] GM: No, it automatically, you cast it.
[01:58:59] GM: It's a con, wait, question.
[01:59:02] Nyx: It's a bonus action.
[01:59:03] Nyx: It's a bonus action.
[01:59:04] Nyx: So I can do it afterwards, right?
[01:59:04] Berridin: I thought it's a,
[01:59:05] Berridin: it's a concentration.
[01:59:06] Berridin: I thought it's not a concentration.
[01:59:07] GM: Yeah, once you cast it.
[01:59:10] GM: Yeah, it stays.
[01:59:11] GM: It stays.
[01:59:13] Berridin: Well,
[01:59:14] Berridin: unless you,

[02:05:04] Nyx: Yeah.
[02:05:05] GM: yeah you're touching yourself
[02:05:13] Ellara: It's a touch spell, so I don't think there's any disadvantages.
[02:05:18] GM: mm-hmm
[02:05:20] Berridin: Yeah,
[02:05:22] Ellara: Heal for 10, and I'll move right here.
[02:05:23] GM: yeah
[02:05:30] GM: don't like that last time
[02:05:32] GM: mm-hmm
[02:05:34] GM: mm-hmm
[02:05:35] Ellara: Presumably now the bandit can't see me at all, right?
[02:05:36] GM: well they could still do an aoe
[02:05:44] GM: uh
[02:05:45] Ellara: Sure, but they wouldn't know where I am, in theory.
[02:05:54] GM: you would have to do a hide action
[02:05:56] GM: we're also seeing the tops of the trees the tops can be like fairly like
[02:05:59] Ellara: Okay. I mean, sure, I'll just stay where I am.
[02:06:07] Ellara: Yeah, that's fair. I'm good.
[02:06:10] GM: um okay so
[02:06:11] Ellara: I knew all my geometry studies would pay off.
[02:06:12] GM: witty it is your turn
[02:06:15] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: As a question,
[02:06:16] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: so I can only cast three spells
[02:06:19] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: and then I have to rest again, right?
[02:06:21] GM: yeah yeah
[02:06:21] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Or like, wait, can I like...
[02:06:22] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Okay, so I can only cast one more spell
[02:06:25] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: in this entire encounter.
[02:06:27] Berridin: it sucks.
[02:06:28] GM: uh
[02:06:28] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Okay.
[02:06:30] GM: well
[02:06:32] GM: you're level three eventually you'll have like a bunch of level one slots and then like you build up
[02:06:35] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Yeah, yeah.
[02:06:36] GM: yeah it sucks but you can uh do pro spellcasters can do probably the most damn it sometimes like yeah i mean that's a whole warlock thing
[02:06:37] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Okay.
[02:06:37] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Yeah.
[02:06:42] Berridin: You can,
[02:06:43] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Mm-hmm.
[02:06:43] Berridin: you,
[02:06:43] Berridin: you can also like,
[02:06:44] Berridin: uh,
[02:06:45] Berridin: add cantrips that are damaged cantrips.
[02:06:47] Berridin: Um,
[02:06:48] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Okay.
[02:06:48] Berridin: and that will,
[02:06:49] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Okay.
[02:06:50] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Can I...
[02:06:51] Berridin: yeah.
[02:06:52] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Mm-hmm.
[02:06:54] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Am I...
[02:06:54] Berridin: And you can like,
[02:06:55] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:06:55] Berridin: you can attack,
[02:06:56] Berridin: you can throw your dagger too,
[02:06:57] Berridin: or something like,
[02:06:59] GM: yeah
[02:06:59] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Am I able to move then cast?
[02:07:01] GM: yeah i don't care what order
[02:07:06] GM: oh okay um so we're just gonna have to go through that so we're just gonna have to go through that
[02:07:07] GM: Oh, OK.
[02:07:07] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Okay, cool.
[02:07:08] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: So I'm going to like,
[02:07:09] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: kind of like sneak through the trees here
[02:07:11] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: a little bit
[02:07:12] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: to like get a nice little like angle.
[02:07:16] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: And then I'm going to...
[02:07:20] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Um...
[02:07:21] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Cast Tasha's Caustic Brew.
[02:07:30] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Um...
[02:07:31] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Which...
[02:07:32] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: So like a stream of acid emanates from me
[02:07:35] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: in a line 30 feet long and 5 feet wide.
[02:07:40] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Um...
[02:07:42] GM: OK, you're going to aim the line.
[02:07:44] GM: Ah, nice.
[02:07:44] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Yeah.
[02:07:45] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: But I don't...
[02:07:45] Berridin: okay,
[02:07:46] Berridin: good.
[02:07:47] Berridin: I like it.
[02:07:48] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: How do I do this?
[02:07:50] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Oh, there you go.
[02:07:50] Berridin: Try to look for the cone overlay.
[02:07:52] Berridin: If that exists.
[02:07:53] GM: No, there's a line overlay.
[02:07:54] Berridin: Oh,
[02:07:55] Berridin: line overlay.
[02:07:55] Berridin: Sorry.
[02:07:57] GM: It's 30 feet long, 5 feet wide.
[02:08:00] GM: I think it automatically does 5 feet.
[02:08:00] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Yep.
[02:08:03] GM: So this is, yeah, you could, oh, you would be very close.
[02:08:03] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Perfect.
[02:08:07] GM: So basically, right in front of Yesenor and Dan,
[02:08:10] GM: you just see like acid.
[02:08:12] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Yep.
[02:08:13] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Yep.
[02:08:14] GM: And a deck save.
[02:08:14] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Yeah.
[02:08:14] Berridin: Acid.
[02:08:15] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: It's like a green bubbling gas
[02:08:17] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: that is very, very caustic.
[02:08:24] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Yeah, it's like a bubbling,
[02:08:26] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: popping, sizzling
[02:08:28] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: green gas.
[02:08:31] GM: OK, they have to do a deck save.
[02:08:33] GM: Cool, cool, cool, cool.
[02:08:35] GM: Where is my battle map?
[02:08:36] GM: Sorry, I really should put it on a separate thing.
[02:08:40] GM: Deck save, they have, they get a 16.
[02:08:44] GM: So I believe they save because your DC is a 13.
[02:08:48] GM: Cool, they'll still probably take some damage.
[02:08:52] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: No, nothing.
[02:08:53] Ellara: No. Unfortunately.
[02:08:57] GM: Oh, they take none.
[02:08:59] GM: Oh, it's not one of those.
[02:09:00] GM: Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:09:01] Ellara: This one is, if it hits, then it's really annoying,
[02:09:01] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Yeah.
[02:09:04] Ellara: because they have to waste an action to get it off.
[02:09:05] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Yeah.
[02:09:06] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: I missed all three of my spells.
[02:09:06] Berridin: I should have chosen.
[02:09:07] GM: OK.
[02:09:11] Ellara: Oh, I've been there. I've been there.
[02:09:11] Berridin: Okay.
[02:09:12] GM: No, Greece, they're still in Greece.
[02:09:12] Berridin: It's okay.
[02:09:14] Berridin: Yeah.
[02:09:16] GM: They just haven't moved.
[02:09:16] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Oh, yeah, yeah.
[02:09:16] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: It's still difficult terrain.
[02:09:18] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Okay.
[02:09:19] GM: Yeah.
[02:09:20] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Um...
[02:09:21] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Okay.
[02:09:21] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Okay, that's it.
[02:09:22] GM: And by the way, movement, you have 30 feet in your turn.
[02:09:25] GM: So you can like move, do an attack, move.
[02:09:28] GM: Like, I don't care.
[02:09:29] GM: Like, they would do that before, where it's like,
[02:09:29] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Okay, yeah.
[02:09:31] GM: I'm hiding behind a tree that gives me cover.
[02:09:34] GM: They move out of the way, poom, move back in.
[02:09:37] GM: That was a classic, classic spell.
[02:09:40] GM: Spell caster, they're like, oh, I'm going to lean out the door.
[02:09:44] GM: Cast, go back in.
[02:09:45] Nyx: Yeah.
[02:09:46] GM: I have a wall.
[02:09:46] Berridin: Yeah.
[02:09:48] GM: So you can be annoying about it.
[02:09:49] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Yeah, so I'll...
[02:09:50] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Oops.
[02:09:52] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: I have the wrong one.
[02:09:53] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Sorry.
[02:09:54] GM: No, it's fine.
[02:09:54] GM: Eh.
[02:09:54] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Um...
[02:09:54] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: So yeah, then I'm going to...
[02:09:56] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Let's see.
[02:09:57] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: So I was here.
[02:09:58] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: So I went from here to here.
[02:10:00] GM: I think I'm like 10 feet.
[02:10:00] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: And now, uh...
[02:10:02] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Yeah, everything...
[02:10:03] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Everything's really, really falling apart for me.
[02:10:05] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: So I am...
[02:10:06] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: I am running away.
[02:10:08] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: I don't think so.
[02:10:10] GM: Fair, fair, fair.
[02:10:11] GM: Ysidor, your turn.
[02:10:18] GM: OK, go for it.
[02:10:23] GM: 19 hits.
[02:10:29] Ysidor: he needs to hit he hits it uh nine then i'm gonna do my last divine smite 15 and i still
[02:10:41] Ysidor: have my divine favor so you can't say that oh and then she has this advantage on her
[02:10:48] GM: Oh, I just did it as we went.
[02:10:50] GM: It's.
[02:10:50] GM: It's.
[02:10:51] GM: It's.
[02:10:51] GM: It's.
[02:10:52] GM: It was like 26 points of damage.
[02:10:55] GM: But yeah.
[02:10:57] GM: Yeah.
[02:10:59] GM: What?
[02:11:01] Ysidor: next attack
[02:11:02] Ysidor: roll yeah no not the little guy yeah was it a crit what was it let's see no i got it
[02:11:03] GM: Yeah, on the first one, right?
[02:11:06] GM: Cool, it's her turn.
[02:11:09] GM: She's getting a little annoyed, but she's
[02:11:10] GM: going to go for the little guy.
[02:11:16] GM: Disadvantage on the first one, right?
[02:11:27] GM: Double crit.
[02:11:27] Ellara: Don't like this. Oh god.
[02:11:32] Berridin: On me,
[02:11:33] Berridin: on me.
[02:11:34] GM: Unferited.
[02:11:36] GM: Do you have a spell slot?
[02:11:36] Berridin: Uh,
[02:11:37] Berridin: can I,
[02:11:37] Berridin: can I,
[02:11:37] Berridin: um,
[02:11:38] Berridin: can I cast a silvery,
[02:11:40] Ysidor: right away oh my god it was a double crit that's crazy
[02:11:40] Berridin: silvery barbs?
[02:11:41] Berridin: To,
[02:11:42] Berridin: uh,
[02:11:43] Berridin: to reroll one of them?
[02:11:44] Berridin: Yeah.
[02:11:46] GM: That is wild.
[02:11:46] Berridin: Yeah.
[02:11:47] Berridin: I have,
[02:11:48] Berridin: I have,
[02:11:49] Berridin: I have one spell slot.
[02:11:54] GM: Yes, you can cast silver.
[02:11:55] Ysidor: it makes sense like you like a chemist wouldn't be like
[02:11:55] GM: You know some DMs ban silvery bar.
[02:11:58] GM: Oops.
[02:11:58] GM: I turned .
[02:11:58] Berridin: I have two spell slots left.
[02:11:59] Berridin: It's probably too OP,
[02:12:00] Berridin: but yeah,
[02:12:01] Berridin: I'm only using it for this situation.
[02:12:02] Berridin: Well,
[02:12:09] Berridin: I mean,
[02:12:10] Berridin: actually,
[02:12:11] GM: Wait, no, it's fine.
[02:12:11] Berridin: what's what,
[02:12:12] Berridin: what's up to you,
[02:12:13] GM: Oh, yeah.
[02:12:13] Berridin: Bobby?
[02:12:14] GM: I'm fine with it.
[02:12:16] GM: I just wanted to know what it did.
[02:12:17] GM: I was going to take it away.
[02:12:18] GM: I wouldn't.
[02:12:18] Berridin: Do you,
[02:12:19] GM: If I were to take it away, it wouldn't be now.
[02:12:21] GM: It'd be later.
[02:12:22] GM: But I'm not going to.
[02:12:23] GM: I would never fuck you over in the moment.
[02:12:26] Berridin: do you want to,
[02:12:27] Berridin: do you want to play with silvery bomb?
[02:12:28] Berridin: Okay.
[02:12:29] Berridin: No,
[02:12:30] GM: to see on the social change casting,
[02:12:32] GM: which you take when a creature you see with.
[02:12:35] GM: OK, yeah.
[02:12:36] GM: You magically distract the character and turn over.
[02:12:41] GM: Okay, so they would
[02:12:42] GM: and use the lower roll. So they just roll
[02:12:45] GM: one more d20. If they get another
[02:12:46] Berridin: no,
[02:12:47] GM: nat 20, that would be hilarious.
[02:12:47] Berridin: whatever,
[02:12:48] Berridin: whatever,
[02:12:49] Berridin: whatever makes sense in your head in terms of balance.
[02:12:50] GM: This was a good chance.
[02:12:50] Berridin: Yeah.
[02:12:51] Berridin: Okay.
[02:12:52] Berridin: Now I would,
[02:12:55] GM: Okay.
[02:12:57] GM: Okay, okay, okay.
[02:12:58] GM: So let's go back to the map.
[02:13:00] GM: Yeah, silvery barbs is
[02:13:02] GM: legit. I need to
[02:13:04] GM: I'm just going to roll the attack roll
[02:13:06] GM: again, just like flat.
[02:13:11] GM: 13
[02:13:11] GM: does not hit.
[02:13:15] GM: Okay. Yeah, so
[02:13:15] Berridin: that doesn't hit,
[02:13:16] GM: you can wait.
[02:13:16] Berridin: but the other one hit,
[02:13:17] Berridin: right?
[02:13:18] GM: No, this is the first attack.
[02:13:20] GM: She just had disadvantage on her first attack.
[02:13:22] GM: I have two more hits.
[02:13:23] Berridin: Okay.
[02:13:24] Berridin: Okay.
[02:13:25] GM: And you have no more
[02:13:25] Berridin: Okay.
[02:13:26] GM: reactions.
[02:13:28] Berridin: I have no more reactions.
[02:13:29] GM: Yeah, because it's only one reaction.
[02:13:31] Berridin: Yeah.
[02:13:32] GM: Okay.
[02:13:32] Berridin: Yeah.
[02:13:34] GM: So
[02:13:34] GM: decide who you're going to give advantage
[02:13:37] GM: to. You can give
[02:13:39] GM: it to yourself, too. Yeah.
[02:13:39] Berridin: Uh,
[02:13:40] Berridin: myself,
[02:13:41] GM: Seven does not
[02:13:41] Berridin: I'll give it to myself.
[02:13:42] GM: hit.
[02:13:43] GM: And 12
[02:13:44] Berridin: Yeah.
[02:13:45] GM: doesn't hit.
[02:13:46] GM: I lost all my luck with that.
[02:13:47] Berridin: No hit,
[02:13:48] Berridin: no hit.
[02:13:49] GM: That was a
[02:13:49] Berridin: Okay.
[02:13:50] GM: You realize I would
[02:13:50] Berridin: Yeah.
[02:13:51] Berridin: I think that would have been a permadeath too.
[02:13:52] Berridin: Holy shit.
[02:13:53] GM: have killed you like 10
[02:13:55] GM: times over.
[02:13:56] GM: I think.
[02:13:57] Nyx: Damn.
[02:13:57] Berridin: You should roll it anyways.
[02:13:58] Berridin: Just want to see what,
[02:13:59] GM: No,
[02:13:59] Berridin: let's see what it is.
[02:14:00] Berridin: Okay.
[02:14:01] GM: like, just the poison
[02:14:01] Berridin: Okay.
[02:14:02] Berridin: Okay.
[02:14:03] GM: alone would have been
[02:14:04] GM: 6d6 of poison damage.
[02:14:08] Berridin: Okay.
[02:14:09] Ellara: Mamma mia. Wait, did I not go?
[02:14:09] Berridin: Okay.
[02:14:10] Berridin: Okay.
[02:14:11] Berridin: Okay.
[02:14:12] Berridin: Okay.
[02:14:13] GM: Oh, yeah, like, let's
[02:14:14] GM: see. It would have been
[02:14:16] GM: 30 points just
[02:14:16] Berridin: Okay.
[02:14:17] GM: on the poison.
[02:14:17] Berridin: That's a,
[02:14:21] Berridin: that's a lot of,
[02:14:22] GM: 11 on that plus two more
[02:14:22] Berridin: that's a lot of fives.
[02:14:23] Berridin: Damn
[02:14:24] GM: d4s. So, like, that would average
[02:14:26] GM: out to four more points. So, it would
[02:14:28] GM: have been, like, 45 points of damage
[02:14:30] GM: ish in the ballpark.
[02:14:35] Nyx: Damn.
[02:14:35] Berridin: these bees of sweat going down Baradun's.
[02:14:38] GM: I think I shat myself.
[02:14:44] GM: By the way, I forgot to
[02:14:46] GM: roll one thing. I just need to roll
[02:14:48] GM: a d6.
[02:14:51] GM: Oh, okay. I don't get that back.
[02:14:53] GM: Cool.
[02:14:56] GM: D6. It is your turn.
[02:14:57] Nyx: Yeah.
[02:14:58] Nyx: My turn.
[02:14:59] Nyx: So, I'm no longer blinded.
[02:14:59] GM: You're no longer blinded.
[02:15:02] Nyx: Fantastic.
[02:15:03] Nyx: And you might be happy to hear I'm not, though.
[02:15:07] Nyx: I no longer have Dreadful Strike.
[02:15:09] GM: You're
[02:15:10] Nyx: So, I do have one more Hunter's Mark, but I...
[02:15:10] GM: No, no.
[02:15:15] Nyx: And I won't use it.
[02:15:16] Nyx: I will use my Hunter's Mark.
[02:15:17] Nyx: But first, I need a roll.
[02:15:18] GM: It's a concentration. So, you
[02:15:20] GM: hold the spell. The spell's still in effect.
[02:15:23] GM: And you can't hold two
[02:15:24] GM: concentrations. Yeah.
[02:15:25] Nyx: And I can use it twice without expending a spell slot.
[02:15:29] Nyx: I get it.
[02:15:30] Nyx: Okay.
[02:15:31] Nyx: Good.
[02:15:31] GM: So, if you had to recast it.

[02:17:51] GM: Looking a bit fucked up.
[02:17:53] GM: Um, Ellara, it is...
[02:17:57] GM: What is he?
[02:17:59] GM: Oh.
[02:17:59] Ellara: Hmm?
[02:18:01] GM: It's a dryer ball.
[02:18:02] GM: Um, Ellara, it's your turn.
[02:18:06] Ellara: Do Guiding Bolt.
[02:18:08] Ellara: Let's attack roll. Oh my god.
[02:18:10] GM: Yeah.
[02:18:11] Ellara: 13.
[02:18:13] GM: Does not hit.
[02:18:15] Ellara: And...
[02:18:18] GM: As you level up, it's easier to hit, but this also has high AC.
[02:18:22] GM: I see.
[02:18:23] GM: Um, okay, Witty, it is your turn.
[02:18:23] Ellara: Yeah, that's it. I'll just move a little further here.
[02:18:26] Ellara: Oops.
[02:18:33] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: So...
[02:18:34] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Uh...
[02:18:34] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: I'm just going to...
[02:18:38] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: I'm just going to...
[02:18:39] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: I'm kind of...
[02:18:40] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: I'm kind of getting a little bored here.
[02:18:43] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Uh...
[02:18:44] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Like, I'm just not helping.
[02:18:45] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: I need to spice things up a little bit.
[02:18:47] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: So I'm just going to cast, like,
[02:18:48] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Minor Illusion.
[02:18:51] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Because that's really all I can do at the moment.
[02:18:55] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: And I'm going to get some, like...
[02:18:58] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Like, you know in, uh...
[02:19:00] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: In Mad Max Fury Road,
[02:19:01] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: how that guitarist was just kind of, like,
[02:19:03] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: just playing some rock music during the chase.
[02:19:06] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: I'm just going to get some drums going.
[02:19:08] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Uh...
[02:19:09] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Above the fire pit.
[02:19:12] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Just get some...
[02:19:13] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Some nice fighting music.
[02:19:16] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Uh...
[02:19:16] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Mortal Kombat-style music going.
[02:19:20] Berridin: no go ahead sorry yeah yeah yeah i don't know if you wanted to use like your other stuff that you
[02:19:21] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Yeah.
[02:19:21] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: And then I'm just going to...
[02:19:22] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: I'm also, like...
[02:19:24] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: I'm just going to kind of inch a little bit closer.
[02:19:27] GM: Okay.
[02:19:27] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Because I'm going to get re...
[02:19:28] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: I'm going to get...
[02:19:28] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: I'm going to get ready to maybe...
[02:19:30] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Maybe do something.
[02:19:32] GM: Okay.
[02:19:32] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: So I'm going to get right in the tree line there.
[02:19:33] GM: Um, no worries.
[02:19:39] GM: Also, I would say...
[02:19:41] GM: What?
[02:19:44] GM: Oh, I would say, like, whatever it was your flask you have ready, you probably have that on you as well.
[02:19:50] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Oh, I have to make...
[02:19:50] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: I didn't...
[02:19:51] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: I didn't roll one.
[02:19:52] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: I didn't roll one earlier.
[02:19:53] GM: Yeah, just roll one.
[02:19:54] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Okay.
[02:20:02] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Now I'm going to use the ones that they have on there.
[02:20:02] Berridin: have matt you can yeah uh i was gonna say um just for matt's edification it's you don't only have
[02:20:05] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: I just have to find them.
[02:20:08] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Like, which ones I have to roll and stuff.
[02:20:11] GM: It's, uh, and it's, we're using the 20-24 rule, so it's better than the, for that.
[02:20:12] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Oops.
[02:20:19] GM: I...
[02:20:20] GM: We...
[02:20:21] GM: What is...
[02:20:26] Berridin: to think of your turn as um in the action economy there's a lot of other things you can do like you
[02:20:33] Berridin: can also use some of your you can give the help action yeah you can there's other actions you can
[02:20:35] GM: You can give help.
[02:20:40] Berridin: take you know you can also do like skill checks if there's some things like you can you can ask
[02:20:42] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Oh, I see.
[02:20:45] Berridin: bobby like do you notice anything
[02:20:47] Berridin: do i notice anything and then he'll have you roll like a perception check and something
[02:20:50] Nyx: Yep.
[02:20:50] Ellara: Yeah.
[02:20:50] Ellara: Yeah, I mean, it also looks like you can infuse items and use Artificer infusions,
[02:20:51] Berridin: sometimes they can help like if you want to identify like their weakness or something or
[02:20:56] Nyx: Right.
[02:20:56] Berridin: if you want to learn something about them um yeah some interesting things and i i think we're gonna
[02:20:58] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Okay.
[02:21:01] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Um...
[02:21:02] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Okay.
[02:21:03] Berridin: we're gonna have to like maybe we'll have to change up some of your cantrips so that you
[02:21:09] Berridin: have some sort of damaging option at your i do yeah yeah
[02:21:18] Ellara: but those probably need to be prepped in advance.
[02:21:21] Ellara: Wait, so what is that? What did you put?
[02:21:22] Berridin: what if there's like a crazy like prep guy there's so many things that when you wake up you have to go
[02:21:24] Nyx: Yeah.
[02:21:28] Berridin: and do all these things but yeah yeah yeah the elixir right experimental yeah got someone yeah
[02:21:34] Ysidor: ready to be like go like without any prep sorry does anyone need like is it is baron still like
[02:21:38] Nyx: But it would make sense for Witty because it's like...
[02:21:41] Nyx: Maybe that's like why he doesn't care about money or any of that stuff.
[02:21:44] Nyx: Because your brain literally can't...
[02:21:47] Nyx: You can't have that in your brain.
[02:21:49] Nyx: It's so full of all this other stuff.
[02:21:51] Nyx: Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.
[02:21:52] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Yes, yes, exactly.
[02:21:58] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Okay, I don't...
[02:21:59] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: I can't figure out where to get...
[02:22:00] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Find that list that we found earlier.
[02:22:02] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: With all the things I can...
[02:22:04] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: That I have to roll for.
[02:22:05] GM: Wait, I'll get it for you.
[02:22:07] GM: Um, I know it's...
[02:22:09] GM: I'll get you the rules.
[02:22:12] GM: Class.
[02:22:14] GM: I think it's a 1d6, but I'll double check.
[02:22:18] GM: Where is Artificer?
[02:22:18] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Yeah, it should be.
[02:22:21] GM: Uh, oh yeah, this is...
[02:22:22] GM: This Artificer just came out, too.
[02:22:24] GM: That's why.
[02:22:26] GM: Uh, it's...
[02:22:27] GM: The Eberron for to the Artificer.
[02:22:31] GM: Uh, Alchemist.
[02:22:34] GM: Yeah, it's a...
[02:22:36] GM: I got it.
[02:22:37] GM: Uh, it's a 1d6, uh, I mean, I'm just gonna put it in OC chat.
[02:22:37] Berridin: go ahead sorry i'm fine i haven't gotten hit somehow no i uh dnd shenaniganed it away
[02:22:45] GM: This is the table.
[02:22:46] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: And I got...
[02:22:47] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: A four.
[02:22:50] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: So...
[02:22:50] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: It's a boldness elixir.
[02:22:51] GM: Boldness.
[02:22:54] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Cool.
[02:22:55] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: So I have that...
[02:22:55] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: I have that just in...
[02:22:57] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: In my pocket.
[02:22:59] GM: Yeah.
[02:23:02] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Cool.
[02:23:02] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: I think I already used an action.
[02:23:04] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: So it's cool.
[02:23:05] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: I want the music still going.
[02:23:09] GM: Okay.
[02:23:09] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: It's important.

[02:23:11] Nyx: Modo.
[02:23:12] GM: We're setting mood.
[02:23:14] GM: Um, which would put it into a Ysidor's turn.

[02:24:08] Ysidor: let's see
[02:24:10] Ysidor: i don't think so
[02:24:13] Ysidor: i don't think so just see um um no i don't have an aura it's level five no pretty sure
[02:24:21] Berridin: we do that thing where you're like you you buff people with that like the attack roll bonus or

[02:31:53] GM: uh, Hýrda.
[02:31:53] Berridin: here oh okay okay amazing she's not a very good bounty hunter she didn't get rid of this note
[02:32:00] GM: It looks like she was also
[02:32:02] GM: going to go after Meri.
[02:32:11] Nyx: Yeah. So I tell, I tell everybody.
[02:32:13] Nyx: Okay.
[02:32:13] Nyx: Who I found. I say, I tell everyone, hey, looks like she was, I mean, I think she thought we were easy marks. That's her last mistake. And she looks like she was also on her way to go after Meri.
[02:32:13] Berridin: oh okay uh i just want to say thanks you know Nyx i think we were all kind of beguiled by
[02:32:15] GM: It doesn't even say the mark,
[02:32:16] GM: it's just the city, town.
[02:32:18] GM: This started after, um,
[02:32:36] Nyx: So, as I said before, you know, just because, you know, I saw that contract on that bulletin means other people saw it too.
[02:32:44] Nyx: So this may not be the.
[02:32:46] Nyx: This won't, probably won't be the first. It was the first, but probably not the last time that we're going to have this situation. Just a heads up.
[02:33:01] Berridin: by her and i'm glad you have a very distrustful approach to everyone
[02:33:08] Berridin: it's gonna keep us alive compliment sandwich
[02:33:11] Nyx: Nyx just, Nyx looks at you and it's like, was that a compliment? Or was it an insult?
[02:33:20] Nyx: Yeah, definitely. I'll take it.
[02:33:20] Berridin: yeah humans kind of suck
[02:33:24] Nyx: I just nod.
[02:33:25] Ysidor: yes the door is looking around yes they're looking around and then panics to the group
[02:33:29] Ysidor: like turns panicky the grouping okay but
[02:33:32] Ysidor: where is the baby and he starts looking okay but everyone
[02:33:40] Ysidor: sat around the baby has to be here somewhere well not right now but when we find the baby
[02:33:45] Nyx: Sidor, there is no baby.
[02:33:51] Ysidor: there will be a baby you know i'm starting to think i shouldn't trust city folks anymore
[02:33:52] Nyx: No.
[02:33:52] Nyx: There, there, the baby was in.
[02:33:56] Nyx: Illusion.
[02:33:58] Nyx: It was magic.
[02:33:59] Nyx: There was no act. There's no actual baby.
[02:34:03] Nyx: It's a spell used to trick people on unsuspecting marks, which this.
[02:34:11] Nyx: Bound this killer thought that they'd be able to get us and treat us as marks.
[02:34:16] Nyx: Um, yeah, they just used that magic to deceive us so that they can get close to us and then steal our stuff and probably kill us.
[02:34:25] Nyx: And I think there is a risk for us, uh, because we're all we're willing to.
[02:34:33] Nyx: I mean, I mean, I can't at this.
[02:34:34] Nyx: I can't, I can't catch up, but I can't move forward.
[02:34:34] Nyx: But you're jumping on something.
[02:34:35] Nyx: I can't, I can't catch up.
[02:34:36] Nyx: I can't understand.
[02:34:36] Nyx: There ishigh you're holding back.
[02:34:39] Nyx: Yeah.
[02:34:39] Nyx: If there's no walkie talkie, I'm really tired of being a num for the week doing memorandum calls.
[02:34:40] Ysidor: this would never happen in my village i didn't have a squibble yes they're just like but she had a
[02:34:41] Nyx: I have information.
[02:34:42] Nyx: Like, you know.
[02:34:43] Nyx: The covid.
[02:34:43] Berridin: okay admit that um we were taken in by this weary traveler
[02:34:44] Nyx: Why?
[02:34:44] Nyx: And it's not more information than you instantly get into a conversation by working on a Youtube.
[02:34:46] Nyx: Oh.
[02:34:46] Nyx: We being pulled on by the tech guy.
[02:34:48] Nyx: No background on the internet.
[02:34:48] Nyx: Oh my God.
[02:34:49] Nyx: It's the 300th time the world has chanted colorful.
[02:34:51] Nyx: Now you're dating another.
[02:34:52] Nyx: we are dealing with people um yeah you know we're this is dangerous what we're doing we're going to
[02:35:03] Nyx: find Meri we're probably going to have to fight when we get there and we're going to have to
[02:35:10] Nyx: fight on the way there and we've already kicked that off who knows how many bounty hunters are
[02:35:15] Nyx: after Meri right so let's be on our guard head on a swivel moving forward
[02:35:23] Nyx: i'm just i'm just got my i kind of i got like the face palm where i'm just like
[02:35:32] Berridin: let our guard down maybe you should give like a like a protocol here or something
[02:35:38] Berridin: the baby the baby got me too i mean it looked pretty real
[02:35:41] Ysidor: baby
[02:35:46] Berridin: yeah that's true that's true yep yeah din din nods in agreement and also
[02:35:49] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: I would rather be stabbed in the middle of the night a million times than let one baby go cold.
[02:36:02] Nyx: we're all gonna fucking die
[02:36:03] Nyx: i just look at everybody and i go look let's keep it simple
[02:36:10] Nyx: okay do not trust anyone
[02:36:14] Nyx: you
[02:36:14] Nyx: that we meet until we've verified okay i'm not saying look i let her sit
[02:36:14] Ysidor: well you would know something about burying bodies it's not yasir they're saying that
[02:36:21] Nyx: right i didn't push her away but i checked that is what i ask for all of us
[02:36:30] Nyx: all right you don't need to be a month i'm not asking you to be a monster i'm asking you
[02:36:36] Nyx: to just verify assume they're trying to trick you until you verified it that's all
[02:36:44] Nyx: i what time is it bobby by the way right now
[02:36:47] Berridin: pointedly looks like he's not a good bounty hunter he's not a good bounty hunter he's not a good
[02:36:47] Berridin: vampire he's not a good player he's not a good
[02:37:02] Ellara: You can tell she's on the verge of tears, and she just...
[02:37:04] Ellara: She just kind of goes and, like, kind of, almost like fetal position next to the fire.
[02:37:18] Nyx: okay okay it's night okay i walk over to Ellara and i i gently put a hand on her shoulder and i
[02:37:21] GM: you had five rounds of combat
[02:37:23] GM: which was like literally this was 30
[02:37:25] GM: seconds after
[02:37:27] GM: you guys finished
[02:37:28] GM: your lunch like your supper
[02:37:31] GM: like it's night
[02:37:33] GM: you just finished eating
[02:37:35] GM: so Matt for a reference Alex's character
[02:37:41] Nyx: just kind of look to the group and i say i i think we're done for the day uh let's just rest
[02:37:50] Nyx: tonight and just camp here um we'll all all
[02:37:56] Nyx: bury the body in the forest and um yeah so and then uh for some unknown reason i just say
[02:37:59] Ellara: You hear a small thank you.
[02:38:12] Nyx: randomly and i'll go make my tentacle hut and then i just look around and i just go
[02:38:19] Nyx: what why did i say that my patron was cthulhu ish and so it was all eldritch all my shit was
[02:38:19] Ellara: Why did I say that?
[02:38:25] GM: had Lehman's tiny hut
[02:38:27] GM: as a spell in the previous campaign
[02:38:29] GM: and it was flavored to look
[02:38:31] GM: made of like tentacles because
[02:38:32] GM: that was his aesthetic
[02:38:33] Ellara: It was Cthulhu's one.
[02:38:34] GM: that was like the creepiest
[02:38:36] GM: you only got it at like level 5 or something
[02:38:42] Nyx: eldritch and so i had a guy who was like i'm gonna go make my tentacle hut and i'm gonna go make my
[02:38:42] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: That's fair.
[02:38:43] Nyx: tentacles and it was luxurious inside but the walls were made out of tentacles and the second
[02:38:51] Nyx: that you got comfortable they would make a creepy sucking nasty noise and then you'd be reminded that
[02:38:51] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Slimy.
[02:38:52] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Do you meditate?
[02:38:56] Nyx: you were in a hut full of tentacles it was fantastic five years of that i was i was committed
[02:38:57] Ysidor: oh my god
[02:39:05] GM: yeah so that was
[02:39:06] Nyx: to the bit you're great man yeah and i would use i do sound effects like when we have a little
[02:39:10] Berridin: it was very comfortable it was nice it was nice it was nice it was good
[02:39:11] GM: how they used to camp great times
[02:39:12] GM: great times
[02:39:13] GM: some of the players would refuse to sleep
[02:39:18] GM: at it
[02:39:18] GM: do I sleep?
[02:39:22] Nyx: porthole that opened up and i would just like i would just like i would just like i would just
[02:39:23] Nyx: up to see who's there
[02:39:24] Nyx: it was great anyway i digress um now you got a little bit of lore yeah go ahead um that's right
[02:39:27] Berridin: just just for sleeping arrangements here
[02:39:36] Berridin: so we are in the perquè
[02:39:37] Berridin: um nicks uh do you like do you like sleep like like we do how does how does this work
[02:39:45] Berridin: yeah do we need someone to like to keep watch over us or can you just
[02:39:47] Nyx: actually because i am a shido gar elf forget the name can i just keep watch bobby do i sleep
[02:39:55] Berridin: yeah like how does that work
[02:39:58] Nyx: or do i how does my guy work it would be under features and
[02:40:01] Ellara: Did I sleep?
[02:40:03] Berridin: is he is he like conscious is he conscious when he's like doing his oh so does that does that
[02:40:05] GM: yeah like that's what I was trying to remember
[02:40:07] GM: because elves typically meditate
[02:40:10] GM: and it's only like four hours
[02:40:11] GM: species trait
[02:40:13] Nyx: let me see
[02:40:15] GM: oh you trance
[02:40:15] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Do you hang upside down from a tree?
[02:40:19] Nyx: on your lookout then okay yeah that works for me yeah i will by default be the lookout unless
[02:40:20] GM: you don't need to sleep and magic can't put you to sleep
[02:40:23] GM: you can finish a long rest in four hours
[02:40:25] GM: if those hours are spent in a trance like meditation
[02:40:27] GM: in which you remain conscious
[02:40:28] GM: yeah
[02:40:31] Berridin: serve as as our lookout like going forward so that does that work okay so we don't have to say
[02:40:37] GM: all I will say
[02:40:38] Berridin: like okay this guy's gonna keep keep watching oh okay okay he has a 14 passive perception okay
[02:40:43] Nyx: we decide for whatever reason somebody else does it i'm cool with that yes yeah got it
[02:40:49] GM: regarding this is
[02:40:50] GM: if something were to happen
[02:40:52] GM: I would assume
[02:40:54] GM: Nyx's passive stat
[02:40:56] GM: as something I would have to be
[02:40:58] GM: yeah so like for example
[02:41:04] Berridin: oh okay no that's perfect so then i don't we don't i don't have to worry about it we can just
[02:41:05] GM: if I was trying to like have someone sneak
[02:41:07] GM: around and Nyx was on guard
[02:41:08] GM: I would have to be the 14th stealth
[02:41:11] GM: that's all I'm saying
[02:41:12] Nyx: that's fair that's very fair awesome can i say something to wit before you you conk off
[02:41:12] Ysidor: oh
[02:41:13] Ysidor: okay oh my god oh
[02:41:13] GM: that's all
[02:41:15] GM: that's all I will say about that
[02:41:17] GM: you guys can decide that
[02:41:19] GM: I will
[02:41:19] GM: but I will use his passives as like
[02:41:22] GM: the
[02:41:22] GM: if I ever want to do anything
[02:41:25] GM: I love that that's how it's done
[02:41:29] Berridin: conk off whenever we go to sleep nicks is nicks is on it yeah okay
[02:41:34] GM: like
[02:41:34] GM: thanks
[02:41:35] GM: cool
[02:41:36] GM: you also have the carriage too
[02:41:38] Berridin: uh oh yeah

[02:41:42] Berridin: okay i called dibs on the carriage
[02:41:44] GM: yeah
[02:41:46] Berridin: i'm a very small person so i don't i i can take up a little thing um yeah i think you can keep
[02:41:56] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: We're about to go to sleep, right?
[02:41:58] GM: yeah

[02:42:23] Nyx: and i go hey um could you if you don't mind assume we're going to have another one of these sort of
[02:42:31] Nyx: events they go like events can you like prep some stuff

[02:42:42] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Yeah.
[02:42:43] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Yeah.
[02:42:45] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Yeah.

[02:42:51] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Yeah, tomorrow morning I can make another...
[02:42:57] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: I can imbue or infuse another item.
[02:43:02] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: So I think I can have two at once.
[02:43:06] Nyx: this is that would be fantastic so just in character i'm talking about like nicks nicks
[02:43:06] Berridin: making elixirs like as long as you have the the mats you can yeah you can just start building it
[02:43:07] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Oh, I can make two...
[02:43:12] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Two every...
[02:43:14] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Three rest.
[02:43:14] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: So, like, I can build them up.
[02:43:18] Berridin: up oh that's so annoying um is that a permanent like creation what does that mean oh so like
[02:43:19] GM: no
[02:43:19] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Okay.
[02:43:20] GM: they vanish after a long rest
[02:43:22] GM: they only last
[02:43:23] GM: they only last between
[02:43:25] GM: yeah
[02:43:25] GM: oh yeah
[02:43:27] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Um, no, it says it vanishes after three days.
[02:43:30] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Oh, that's after I die.
[02:43:32] GM: no but like between long rest
[02:43:35] GM: like so
[02:43:35] GM: whatever elixir you had now
[02:43:37] GM: if you didn't consume it
[02:43:38] GM: when you do long rest
[02:43:39] GM: it goes away
[02:43:40] GM: and you pick your new ones
[02:43:41] GM: but as you level up
[02:43:41] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Oh, okay.
[02:43:43] GM: you get more elixirs
[02:43:45] GM: that's how you get more
[02:43:46] GM: oh also you can use spell slots
[02:43:47] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Okay.
[02:43:51] GM: to make more too
[02:43:52] GM: so I'm just gonna
[02:43:57] Nyx: doesn't know all these little details i don't know i just this is just what i've seen so i'm
[02:44:02] Nyx: when i'm talking to you i'm not like telling you to do specific things i'm just like reminding you
[02:44:06] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Mm-hmm.
[02:44:08] Nyx: like hey man i know a bit about i must this i probably know a little bit about artificers and
[02:44:16] Nyx: i'm probably putting two and two together a little bit and so it's like you gotta prep right
[02:44:18] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Mm-hmm.
[02:44:21] Nyx: and maybe i need to tell you to prep but if you just go do your thing but assume this will happen
[02:44:26] Nyx: again and that might be helpful that's all awesome whoa whoa that's cool that's awesome
[02:44:27] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Mm-hmm.
[02:44:30] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Sounds good.
[02:44:35] GM: one of the things that I'm going to do is
[02:44:38] GM: things you can do
[02:44:39] GM: I think this is part of the new rules
[02:44:40] GM: is you at level two
[02:44:42] GM: you have replicate magic item
[02:44:43] GM: for witty
[02:44:48] GM: so

[02:44:53] GM: make a bag of holding and stuff
[02:44:54] GM: magic isn't permanent
[02:44:55] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Okay.
[02:45:05] GM: when he dies
[02:45:06] GM: it's 1d4
[02:45:07] GM: like as long as he's living
[02:45:11] GM: it exists
[02:45:12] GM: yeah one or two
[02:45:14] Nyx: wow yeah right oh nice yeah that's cool yeah
[02:45:14] Berridin: any number of these magic items exist like that wow there's no there's so much potential here it's
[02:45:18] GM: if he has tinkering tools in hands
[02:45:20] GM: it's true
[02:45:24] GM: yeah
[02:45:25] GM: yeah
[02:45:27] Berridin: kind of crazy yeah oh god okay that's awesome and i i do believe one of the changes they made
[02:45:29] GM: yeah
[02:45:29] GM: and like as he levels up
[02:45:30] GM: he can create more
[02:45:31] GM: yeah so like
[02:45:36] GM: yeah so from level two up
[02:45:38] GM: it's alchemy jug
[02:45:40] GM: bag of holding
[02:45:40] GM: cap of water breathing
[02:45:41] GM: common magic items
[02:45:43] GM: that isn't a potion
[02:45:44] GM: scroll or cursed
[02:45:45] GM: goggles of night
[02:45:46] GM: manifold tool
[02:45:47] GM: blah blah blah
[02:45:47] GM: at level six
[02:45:48] GM: there's more
[02:45:50] GM: at level 10
[02:45:50] GM: there's more
[02:45:51] GM: 14 there's more
[02:45:52] GM: bonus action
[02:45:58] Berridin: in artifice or for the new version is that or for alchemists i don't know if it's artifice or
[02:46:03] Berridin: alchemist but it's no it's no longer a an action to consume one of these elixirs it's a bonus
[02:46:08] GM: bonus action
[02:46:09] GM: yeah
[02:46:09] Berridin: action yeah that makes it a lot easier to use because i know that was a big pain point before
[02:46:14] GM: and at a six
[02:46:15] GM: he can pick which one he wants
[02:46:16] GM: if he rolls a six
[02:46:17] GM: oh if they're gas
[02:46:18] Berridin: um would it be fair i mean again this is more of a flavor thing and this might change the balance a
[02:46:24] Berridin: little bit but would it be fair like to say that he could like like instead of instead of these
[02:46:29] Berridin: instead of these are drinks these are kind of gaseous concoctions could he like kind of yeah yeah
[02:46:34] GM: yeah he can hop them
[02:46:35] GM: if you want them to be poppers
[02:46:37] GM: go for it
[02:46:38] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: They're definitely poppers.
[02:46:39] GM: i just hear
[02:46:39] Berridin: could he could he like theoretically could he theoretically throw throw one of these like at at us
[02:46:40] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Yeah.
[02:46:43] GM: no
[02:46:46] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Well, I figure I...
[02:46:46] Berridin: like oh my god okay
[02:46:47] GM: you can hand them off
[02:46:48] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Oh.
[02:46:48] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: I can't, like, hand them off?
[02:46:50] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Because I...
[02:46:50] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: I don't...
[02:46:51] GM: you can hand them off
[02:46:51] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Okay.
[02:46:52] GM: you can hand them off
[02:46:52] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Okay.
[02:46:53] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Is there a range?
[02:46:53] Berridin: yeah uh yeah yeah yeah that makes sense okay that's cool okay awesome
[02:46:54] GM: five feet
[02:46:55] GM: let's reach
[02:46:56] GM: yeah
[02:46:56] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Five feet?
[02:46:57] GM: so like
[02:46:57] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Okay.
[02:46:58] GM: you could give them for the day
[02:47:00] GM: when you take the long rest
[02:47:01] GM: i would say your canisters
[02:47:02] GM: would just be
[02:47:03] GM: so like
[02:47:06] GM: i say you gave one
[02:47:07] GM: to din
[02:47:07] GM: um it was like
[02:47:09] GM: uh whatever
[02:47:10] GM: din didn't use it
[02:47:11] GM: you long rest
[02:47:12] GM: din when din goes
[02:47:14] GM: the next morning
[02:47:14] GM: it's just empty
[02:47:15] GM: and the
[02:47:16] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Okay.
[02:47:17] GM: the logic would be
[02:47:18] GM: oh it's unstable
[02:47:19] GM: so i fall apart
[02:47:20] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Sounds good.
[02:47:21] GM: yeah
[02:47:22] GM: but like
[02:47:24] GM: yeah you can make them
[02:47:25] GM: and hand them out
[02:47:26] GM: or in combat
[02:47:27] GM: if they're in
[02:47:28] GM: uh physical
[02:47:28] GM: and uh
[02:47:29] GM: melee range
[02:47:30] GM: you can give them to it
[02:47:31] GM: which is five feet
[02:47:32] GM: i
[02:47:33] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Okay.
[02:47:33] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: And I can attune, like, party members' items too, right?
[02:47:36] GM: yeah i ignore
[02:47:39] GM: the attunement rules
[02:47:40] GM: so don't worry
[02:47:40] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Oh, okay.
[02:47:41] GM: um
[02:47:42] GM: it
[02:47:43] GM: that just seems like
[02:47:44] GM: too much hassle
[02:47:45] GM: they're like
[02:47:46] GM: have you been spending
[02:47:47] GM: special time
[02:47:48] GM: with your items
[02:47:49] GM: to become friends
[02:47:50] GM: with it
[02:47:56] GM: yeah
[02:47:59] Berridin: um did uh did the loot produce any gold from the dead body
[02:48:05] Ellara: Did the body produce gold?
[02:48:07] Ellara: When the body disappeared, as dead bodies do,
[02:48:10] GM: um
[02:48:11] GM: roll a d8
[02:48:12] GM: two pieces of gold
[02:48:13] GM: um

[02:49:14] Ysidor: or Michelle
[02:49:17] GM: yeah
[02:49:18] GM: uh
[02:49:19] GM: how
[02:49:20] GM: so going to sleep
[02:49:21] GM: Ellara
[02:49:22] GM: is
[02:49:23] GM: in her field
[02:49:24] GM: um
[02:49:25] GM: i mean
[02:49:26] GM: valid
[02:49:27] GM: very valid
[02:49:27] Ellara: if the truth is accurate, I'll get back to you.
[02:49:28] GM: is this the first time
[02:49:29] GM: Ellara
[02:49:30] GM: seen someone
[02:49:30] Berridin: that's fair what was that uh nope so eloquent yeah nice uh Matt by the way if you uh when you

[02:49:35] GM: not die
[02:49:36] GM: fair
[02:49:37] GM: uh
[02:49:43] Ellara: Because last time we thought it was just the robots,
[02:49:44] GM: uh
[02:49:45] Ellara: because there wasn't a human involved.
[02:49:50] GM: yeah
[02:49:51] GM: no one saw
[02:49:52] GM: what happened
[02:49:52] Ellara: Oh, yeah. Probably never seen someone get killed.
[02:49:53] GM: to michelle
[02:49:55] Ellara: I don't think so.
[02:49:56] GM: fabergé
[02:49:57] Ysidor: what do you think we're doing out there

[02:52:10] Ellara: Thank you for coming.
[02:52:11] Ellara: I know that it probably had to be done, but I had...
[02:52:17] Ellara: And then she just trails off.
[02:52:29] Nyx: i do i do bad things but i'm not a monster and then i just kind of turn back because i don't
[02:52:36] Nyx: know what to say yeah exactly that's it's like i don't know how to get this across

[02:52:48] Ysidor: oh my god
[02:52:51] Nyx: and it's like i'm trying it's my way of doing a terrible job of making her feel better
[02:52:59] GM: thing

[02:53:30] Ellara: No, I'm an assassin, but my heart is not complete garbage.
[02:53:35] Ellara: That's...
[02:53:36] Ysidor: except for Baradun
[02:53:42] GM: um before you head off yeah yeah and i will allow like because you're traveling like passively
[02:53:43] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Well, before...
[02:53:44] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Okay.
[02:53:45] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: I don't know if I can retcon this a little bit,
[02:53:47] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: but I can...
[02:53:48] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: I have, like, the right tool for the job, right?
[02:53:51] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: And I need Tinker's tools to craft one of these items.
[02:53:55] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: So, like, just coinciding with my rest,
[02:53:58] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: I want to, like, create a set...
[02:54:01] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: of Tinker's tools.
[02:54:03] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: So I'll have them in the morning
[02:54:04] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: to make a magic item.
[02:54:12] GM: um you can like tinker while you're in the cart so that's basically
[02:54:15] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Oh, cool.
[02:54:16] GM: witty side of the cart just like nice yeah and um yeah so you don't have to like undo it
[02:54:19] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Yeah.
[02:54:20] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: And then, yeah, in the morning,
[02:54:22] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: before we do anything,
[02:54:23] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: I'm going to make another elixir or whatever.
[02:54:29] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: A one.
[02:54:31] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: And it is a three.
[02:54:39] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Resilience.
[02:54:40] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: So I have a resilience and a boldness.
[02:54:42] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: I'll add those.
[02:54:48] Berridin: click on that long rest button that's how you that's how you actually reset everything on the
[02:54:53] Berridin: character sheet do you see it yeah that will
[02:54:54] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Oh, I see.
[02:54:56] GM: and it heals you all all your long rest check boxes will get reset um uh there's not they don't
[02:54:58] Berridin: yeah I'll heal you to Max and it'll also reset your spell slots
[02:55:03] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Okay, cool.
[02:55:07] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Cool.
[02:55:07] Berridin: yeah yeah this is gonna I think you're gonna have to like I what I would do is I would add like all
[02:55:08] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: And how do I add something to my inventory
[02:55:09] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: so that I know I have these infused items?
[02:55:19] Berridin: the different types of elixirs as temporary inventory items and then just change the the
[02:55:22] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Mm-hmm.
[02:55:26] Berridin: number of that during the day to help you keep track like so if you know that you have this many
[02:55:32] Berridin: boldness or this many Resiliences or this many pots
[02:55:36] Berridin: um
[02:55:37] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Mm-hmm.
[02:55:38] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: So I can make them...
[02:55:38] Berridin: and then that way at least you can like see it I don't know if there's an easier way to handle that
[02:55:42] Berridin: in this thing yeah yeah you can you can use either like your your own notes or you can use something
[02:55:44] GM: it's weird because for some features they don't build anything in it's like companions right
[02:55:48] GM: like if you have like a familiar or a companion
[02:55:52] GM: there's no way to build anything in it's like companions right like if you have like a familiar
[02:55:53] GM: you just have to track it it's supposed to be a digital sheet but like yeah yeah
[02:56:03] Berridin: in D&D Beyond like there's a there's a whole notes tab there that you can add um you can also use it
[02:56:06] Ellara: Yeah.
[02:56:09] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: I can make custom items
[02:56:09] Berridin: right yeah and sometimes that's nice because like some of the items you can you can like they
[02:56:11] Ellara: Yeah, I think that's probably the easiest.
[02:56:11] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: and then just add that to my inventory.
[02:56:12] GM: yeah yeah yeah and uh one of the things you'll probably have to just not during the session but
[02:56:13] Ellara: Yeah.
[02:56:14] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: So that's what I just did for...
[02:56:15] Whitaker "Witty" Whitman VI: Okay.
[02:56:21] Berridin: actually impact your stats if you if you needed to um so it's kind of interesting
[02:56:26] Berridin: um yeah I want to level up DM
[02:56:30] GM: uh edit your character sheet and then in the builder you can select the everon um
[02:56:35] GM: artificer and they'll update all your stats but like that that's another thing but anyways we're
[02:56:42] GM: back to the show
[02:56:43] GM: back to the morning you've made your things tinkering tools uh you're ready to go anything
[02:56:47] GM: else was actually i forgot and i was gonna allow you guys to level up but because you said that
[02:56:57] Berridin: I shut up I was not
[02:57:01] GM: i'm not i'm a spiteful little bitch
[02:57:08] GM: i want to level up nah um uh yeah so um anything else before you get on
[02:57:18] Berridin: that was meta commentary that was not in character yeah you're welcome everyone that was me

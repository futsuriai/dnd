[00:00:03 -> 00:04:05]  thanks craig i just want to say that it could get around the world in 80 days so like at maximum we
[00:04:05 -> 00:04:10]  would have gotten there like regardless of which direction we went we would have been there within
[00:04:10 -> 00:05:15]  80 days so at least we had a good view well is the bank still open will it open in the morning
[00:05:15 -> 00:05:20]  before we leave i should probably like before i leave a city see like if i'm able to withdraw
[00:05:20 -> 00:05:33]  any funds from my family uh account okay yeah yeah i think i mentioned that last time yeah
[00:05:33 -> 00:05:50]  yeah that'd be great uh yeah i think i was on my own at this point yeah it didn't last me i
[00:05:50 -> 00:05:54]  invited him to see if he wanted to come to the bank well actually he probably might want to come
[00:05:54 -> 00:07:18]  with me if i said i was going to get money good afternoon uh good afternoon ma'am i am uh
[00:07:18 -> 00:07:22]  of the whitman estate and i need to make a withdrawal from
[00:07:22 -> 00:07:22]  our
[00:07:22 -> 00:07:22]  uh

[00:08:12 -> 00:08:21]  withdrawal he made oh about two weeks ago perfect so um can i make uh both last week's withdrawal
[00:08:21 -> 00:08:44]  and this week's withdrawal so 400 gold well this is this is you know an interesting development
[00:08:44 -> 00:08:52]  because uh you know jarvis quit uh more than that
[00:08:52 -> 00:09:00]  ago and uh so this would be fraud um so uh what's what's your bank yeah

[02:08:26 -> 02:08:28]  popping, sizzling
[02:08:28 -> 02:08:30]  green gas.
[02:08:52 -> 02:09:00]  No, nothing.

[02:09:16 -> 02:09:16]  Oh, yeah, yeah.

[02:09:21 -> 02:09:21]  Okay.

[02:09:56 -> 02:09:57]  Let's see.
[02:09:57 -> 02:09:57]  So I was here.
[02:09:58 -> 02:10:00]  So I went from here to here.
[02:10:00 -> 02:10:02]  And now, uh...
[02:10:02 -> 02:10:03]  Yeah, everything...
[02:10:03 -> 02:10:05]  Everything's really, really falling apart for me.
[02:10:05 -> 02:10:06]  So I am...
[02:10:06 -> 02:10:07]  I am running away.
[02:10:08 -> 02:16:53]  I don't think so.
[02:16:53 -> 02:18:32]  Um, all right.
[02:18:33 -> 02:18:34]  So...
[02:18:34 -> 02:18:34]  Uh...
[02:18:34 -> 02:18:38]  I'm just going to...
[02:18:38 -> 02:18:39]  I'm just going to...
[02:18:39 -> 02:18:40]  I'm kind of...
[02:18:40 -> 02:18:41]  I'm kind of getting a little bored here.
[02:18:43 -> 02:18:44]  Uh...
[02:18:44 -> 02:18:45]  Like, I'm just not helping.
[02:18:45 -> 02:18:46]  I need to spice things up a little bit.
[02:18:47 -> 02:18:48]  So I'm just going to cast, like,
[02:18:48 -> 02:18:49]  Minor Illusion.
[02:18:51 -> 02:18:53]  Because that's really all I can do at the moment.
[02:18:55 -> 02:18:58]  And I'm going to get some, like...
[02:18:58 -> 02:19:00]  Like, you know in, uh...
[02:19:00 -> 02:19:01]  In Mad Max Fury Road,
[02:19:01 -> 02:19:03]  how that guitarist was just kind of, like,
[02:19:03 -> 02:19:06]  just playing some rock music during the chase.
[02:19:06 -> 02:19:08]  I'm just going to get some drums going.
[02:19:08 -> 02:19:09]  Uh...
[02:19:09 -> 02:19:11]  Above the fire pit.
[02:19:12 -> 02:19:13]  Just get some...
[02:19:13 -> 02:19:14]  Some nice fighting music.
[02:19:16 -> 02:19:16]  Uh...
[02:19:16 -> 02:19:19]  Mortal Kombat-style music going.
[02:19:21 -> 02:19:21]  Yeah.
[02:19:21 -> 02:19:22]  And then I'm just going to...
[02:19:22 -> 02:19:24]  I'm also, like...
[02:19:24 -> 02:19:25]  I'm just going to kind of inch a little bit closer.
[02:19:27 -> 02:19:28]  Because I'm going to get re...
[02:19:28 -> 02:19:28]  I'm going to get...
[02:19:28 -> 02:19:30]  I'm going to get ready to maybe...
[02:19:30 -> 02:19:31]  Maybe do something.
[02:19:32 -> 02:19:35]  So I'm going to get right in the tree line there.
[02:19:50 -> 02:19:50]  Oh, I have to make...
[02:19:50 -> 02:19:51]  I didn't...
[02:19:51 -> 02:19:52]  I didn't roll one.
[02:19:52 -> 02:19:53]  I didn't roll one earlier.
[02:19:54 -> 02:19:55]  Okay.
[02:20:02 -> 02:20:04]  Now I'm going to use the ones that they have on there.
[02:20:05 -> 02:20:07]  I just have to find them.
[02:20:08 -> 02:20:10]  Like, which ones I have to roll and stuff.
[02:20:12 -> 02:20:12]  Oops.
[02:20:42 -> 02:20:44]  Oh, I see.
[02:20:58 -> 02:20:58]  Okay.
[02:21:01 -> 02:21:02]  Um...
[02:21:02 -> 02:21:03]  Okay.
[02:21:52 -> 02:21:53]  Yes, yes, exactly.
[02:21:58 -> 02:21:59]  Okay, I don't...
[02:21:59 -> 02:22:00]  I can't figure out where to get...
[02:22:00 -> 02:22:02]  Find that list that we found earlier.
[02:22:02 -> 02:22:04]  With all the things I can...
[02:22:04 -> 02:22:06]  That I have to roll for.
[02:22:18 -> 02:22:19]  Yeah, it should be.
[02:22:46 -> 02:22:47]  And I got...
[02:22:47 -> 02:22:48]  A four.
[02:22:50 -> 02:22:50]  So...
[02:22:50 -> 02:22:53]  It's a boldness elixir.
[02:22:54 -> 02:22:55]  Cool.
[02:22:55 -> 02:22:55]  So I have that...
[02:22:55 -> 02:22:57]  I have that just in...
[02:22:57 -> 02:22:58]  In my pocket.
[02:23:02 -> 02:23:02]  Cool.
[02:23:02 -> 02:23:03]  I think I already used an action.
[02:23:04 -> 02:23:04]  So it's cool.
[02:23:05 -> 02:23:06]  I want the music still going.
[02:23:09 -> 02:23:10]  It's important.
[02:23:10 -> 02:23:11]  It's important, yeah.
[02:31:15 -> 02:31:16]  What do you like?
[02:31:16 -> 02:31:17]  Peaks?
[02:31:17 -> 02:31:18]  His way around...
[02:31:18 -> 02:31:19]  Oh, go ahead.
[02:35:49 -> 02:35:54]  I would rather be stabbed in the middle of the night a million times than let one baby go cold.
[02:38:42 -> 02:38:43]  That's fair.
[02:38:51 -> 02:38:52]  Slimy.
[02:38:52 -> 02:40:04]  Do you meditate?
[02:40:15 -> 02:40:17]  Do you hang upside down from a tree?
[02:41:56 -> 02:41:57]  We're about to go to sleep, right?
[02:41:58 -> 02:41:59]  Yeah, I like...
[02:41:59 -> 02:42:00]  I like crack...
[02:42:00 -> 02:42:02]  Crack my neck and, like, you know, stretch out.
[02:42:02 -> 02:42:03]  And I was just like, wow.
[02:42:03 -> 02:42:05]  You guys are really lucky I was there today.
[02:42:07 -> 02:42:09]  And then, uh...
[02:42:09 -> 02:42:11]  I just...
[02:42:11 -> 02:42:11]  I'm gonna...
[02:42:11 -> 02:42:14]  I'm gonna also, uh...
[02:42:14 -> 02:42:16]  Sleep in the carriage as well.
[02:42:20 -> 02:42:21]  Sure.
[02:42:42 -> 02:42:43]  Yeah.
[02:42:43 -> 02:42:43]  Yeah.
[02:42:45 -> 02:42:46]  Yeah.
[02:42:50 -> 02:42:51]  Yeah.
[02:42:51 -> 02:42:57]  Yeah, tomorrow morning I can make another...
[02:42:57 -> 02:43:01]  I can imbue or infuse another item.
[02:43:02 -> 02:43:04]  So I think I can have two at once.
[02:43:07 -> 02:43:12]  Oh, I can make two...
[02:43:12 -> 02:43:13]  Two every...
[02:43:14 -> 02:43:14]  Three rest.
[02:43:14 -> 02:43:16]  So, like, I can build them up.
[02:43:19 -> 02:43:19]  Okay.
[02:43:27 -> 02:43:29]  Um, no, it says it vanishes after three days.
[02:43:30 -> 02:43:31]  Oh, that's after I die.
[02:43:41 -> 02:43:42]  Oh, okay.
[02:43:47 -> 02:43:48]  Okay.
[02:44:06 -> 02:44:06]  Mm-hmm.
[02:44:18 -> 02:44:19]  Mm-hmm.
[02:44:27 -> 02:44:28]  Mm-hmm.
[02:44:30 -> 02:44:31]  Sounds good.
[02:44:55 -> 02:44:56]  Okay.
[02:46:38 -> 02:46:39]  They're definitely poppers.
[02:46:40 -> 02:46:40]  Yeah.
[02:46:46 -> 02:46:48]  Well, I figure I...
[02:46:48 -> 02:46:48]  Oh.
[02:46:48 -> 02:46:50]  I can't, like, hand them off?
[02:46:50 -> 02:46:50]  Because I...
[02:46:50 -> 02:46:51]  I don't...
[02:46:51 -> 02:46:52]  Okay.
[02:46:52 -> 02:46:52]  Okay.
[02:46:53 -> 02:46:54]  Is there a range?
[02:46:56 -> 02:46:56]  Five feet?
[02:46:57 -> 02:46:57]  Okay.
[02:47:16 -> 02:47:16]  Okay.
[02:47:20 -> 02:47:21]  Sounds good.
[02:47:33 -> 02:47:33]  Okay.
[02:47:33 -> 02:47:37]  And I can attune, like, party members' items too, right?
[02:47:40 -> 02:47:41]  Oh, okay.
[02:53:43 -> 02:53:44]  Well, before...
[02:53:44 -> 02:53:45]  Okay.
[02:53:45 -> 02:53:47]  I don't know if I can retcon this a little bit,
[02:53:47 -> 02:53:48]  but I can...
[02:53:48 -> 02:53:51]  I have, like, the right tool for the job, right?
[02:53:51 -> 02:53:55]  And I need Tinker's tools to craft one of these items.
[02:53:55 -> 02:53:58]  So, like, just coinciding with my rest,
[02:53:58 -> 02:54:01]  I want to, like, create a set...
[02:54:01 -> 02:54:02]  of Tinker's tools.
[02:54:03 -> 02:54:04]  So I'll have them in the morning
[02:54:04 -> 02:54:07]  to make a magic item.
[02:54:15 -> 02:54:16]  Oh, cool.
[02:54:19 -> 02:54:19]  Yeah.
[02:54:20 -> 02:54:22]  And then, yeah, in the morning,
[02:54:22 -> 02:54:23]  before we do anything,
[02:54:23 -> 02:54:29]  I'm going to make another elixir or whatever.
[02:54:29 -> 02:54:30]  A one.
[02:54:31 -> 02:54:38]  And it is a three.
[02:54:39 -> 02:54:39]  Resilience.
[02:54:40 -> 02:54:42]  So I have a resilience and a boldness.
[02:54:42 -> 02:54:44]  I'll add those.
[02:54:54 -> 02:54:55]  Oh, I see.
[02:55:03 -> 02:55:04]  Okay, cool.
[02:55:07 -> 02:55:07]  Cool.
[02:55:08 -> 02:55:09]  And how do I add something to my inventory
[02:55:09 -> 02:55:13]  so that I know I have these infused items?
[02:55:22 -> 02:55:23]  Mm-hmm.
[02:55:37 -> 02:55:37]  Mm-hmm.
[02:55:38 -> 02:56:09]  So I can make them...
[02:56:09 -> 02:56:11]  I can make custom items
[02:56:11 -> 02:56:13]  and then just add that to my inventory.
[02:56:14 -> 02:56:15]  So that's what I just did for...
[02:56:15 -> 02:56:39]  Okay.
[02:59:13 -> 02:59:13]  Nice.

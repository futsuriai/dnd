[00:03:32 -> 00:03:41]  i'm a little i'm a little bitter about it i'll be honest
[00:03:41 -> 00:03:47]  when i found out it didn't have forward propulsion
[00:03:47 -> 00:04:14]  i'm just led here under false pretenses um yeah so nix just kind of was literally i i'm imagining
[00:04:14 -> 00:04:20]  little side thing i do imagine the scene like if this were animated adventure and we did that we
[00:04:20 -> 00:04:20]  went through it and we did that and we did that and we did that and we did that and we did that
[00:04:20 -> 00:04:24]  the hot air balloon and there's a scene where like we're flying over where mary is supposed
[00:04:24 -> 00:04:30]  to be and everything's on fire like and all the soldiers there all the automatons are there
[00:04:30 -> 00:04:38]  the war forges everything's destroyed and you witty just goes well at least we got the hot air
[00:04:38 -> 00:04:50]  balloon yeah anyway i digress so nix just goes upon you all right look so we're heading out
[00:04:50 -> 00:04:59]  tomorrow morning let's get there at first light let's leave a first light grab all your stuff
[00:04:59 -> 00:05:06]  so make sure you have everything before we head out

[00:27:25 -> 00:28:02]  this is like villain origin story
[00:28:02 -> 00:28:08]  it's very concerning that barrett is more concerned about this than witty
[00:28:08 -> 00:28:38]  yeah yeah beyond you and figure that out can't be me go kill the button
[00:28:38 -> 00:29:37]  oh my god oh my god yeah yeah in three different places

[00:29:47 -> 00:29:48]  for D&D.
[00:29:54 -> 00:29:56]  How do liens work?
[00:30:13 -> 00:30:19]  Do you tell us,
[00:30:19 -> 00:30:19]  Jen?
[00:30:22 -> 00:30:23]  Does anybody...
[00:30:23 -> 00:30:24]  Yeah, do you say?
[00:30:25 -> 00:30:38]  How much money did you pull out?
[00:30:39 -> 00:30:41]  That is Nick's asking.
[00:30:41 -> 00:30:46]  No, no. What's the number?
[00:30:49 -> 00:30:49]  What's the number?
[00:30:49 -> 00:30:51]  I want to know what we're dealing with.
[00:30:51 -> 00:30:52]  What do we have?
[00:30:53 -> 00:30:54]  It's very important.
[00:31:00 -> 00:31:00]  Baradun.
[00:31:02 -> 00:31:03]  I'm not going to ask again.
[00:31:07 -> 00:31:10]  Witty, how much money do you have?
[00:31:11 -> 00:31:12]  How much did you...
[00:31:12 -> 00:31:13]  How much did you...
[00:31:13 -> 00:31:15]  I...
[00:31:15 -> 00:31:16]  Okay.
[00:31:17 -> 00:31:18]  All right.
[00:31:18 -> 00:31:21]  How much did you withdraw from the bank?
[00:31:21 -> 00:31:28]  Just so that we...
[00:31:28 -> 00:31:28]  Baradun.
[00:31:41 -> 00:31:42]  Baradun.
[00:31:43 -> 00:31:46]  My default is not to believe your numbers.
[00:31:46 -> 00:31:48]  I believe you, but I don't believe your numbers.
[00:31:49 -> 00:31:50]  So I'm going to try it again.
[00:31:51 -> 00:31:52]  Please be reasonable.
[00:31:52 -> 00:32:02]  How much did you actually...
[00:32:02 -> 00:32:03]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:32:03 -> 00:32:08]  This is...
[00:32:08 -> 00:32:10]  Yeah, no, no, no.
[00:32:10 -> 00:32:11]  Just look.
[00:32:13 -> 00:32:13]  Yeah.
[00:32:14 -> 00:32:16]  Look, I don't actually...
[00:32:16 -> 00:32:19]  I'm not trying to find out
[00:32:19 -> 00:32:21]  how much, how richer you are.
[00:32:21 -> 00:32:23]  I just want to know,
[00:32:23 -> 00:32:24]  moving forward,
[00:32:25 -> 00:32:26]  what are our funds?
[00:32:27 -> 00:32:30]  Because we make decisions off that.
[00:32:38 -> 00:32:38]  All right.
[00:32:38 -> 00:32:40]  I'll go under that assumption.
[00:32:45 -> 00:32:47]  I will, but yeah.
[00:32:49 -> 00:32:50]  That's fine.
[00:32:50 -> 00:32:51]  I got a plus four,
[00:32:51 -> 00:32:52]  and I got a 19.
[00:32:53 -> 00:32:53]  Beat it, meet it.
[00:32:54 -> 00:32:54]  Meet it, beat it.
[00:33:15 -> 00:33:15]  Yeah.
[00:33:17 -> 00:33:17]  Yeah.
[00:33:21 -> 00:33:22]  Yeah.
[00:33:22 -> 00:33:25]  Because 2,000 would be such a fucking good number.
[00:33:26 -> 00:33:27]  Such a good number.
[00:33:27 -> 00:33:27]  Yeah.
[00:33:29 -> 00:33:34]  Can you do that?
[00:33:39 -> 00:33:41]  Yeah, you can't just keep doing that.
[00:33:42 -> 00:33:43]  What are the rules?
[00:33:46 -> 00:33:48]  Because now I don't trust him at all.
[00:33:51 -> 00:33:53]  How do we go about...
[00:33:53 -> 00:33:53]  What do I roll?
[00:33:57 -> 00:33:58]  Don't make me do a sleight of hand.
[00:34:07 -> 00:34:09]  So what do I have to roll?
[00:34:15 -> 00:34:15]  Okay, yeah.
[00:34:15 -> 00:34:16]  I got a 16.
[00:34:16 -> 00:34:17]  Let me roll again.
[00:34:22 -> 00:34:23]  And then a six.
[00:34:44 -> 00:34:45]  Right.
[00:34:45 -> 00:34:47]  Can I ask one more question to Baradun?
[00:34:48 -> 00:34:50]  Yeah, I'm just going to say,
[00:34:50 -> 00:34:52]  okay, I get that you're...
[00:34:52 -> 00:34:54]  Okay, work with me here.
[00:34:54 -> 00:34:57]  I get that you don't want to tell me the number.
[00:34:57 -> 00:34:59]  I've conceded that.
[00:34:59 -> 00:35:00]  Fine.
[00:35:00 -> 00:35:02]  Is it over a thousand?
[00:35:03 -> 00:35:06]  I just want to know what the minimum is.
[00:35:08 -> 00:35:08]  Okay.
[00:35:09 -> 00:35:13]  Because that can hurt us as a team if we don't know what the minimum is.
[00:35:13 -> 00:35:14]  I don't care about how...
[00:35:19 -> 00:35:22]  No, I just want to know what the amount is.
[00:35:22 -> 00:35:23]  So just give me the minimum.
[00:35:25 -> 00:35:25]  Minimum.
[00:35:35 -> 00:35:35]  Yeah.
[00:35:43 -> 00:35:44]  I've been paying for shit.
[00:35:47 -> 00:35:49]  I've been doing that hard work for everything.
[00:36:09 -> 00:36:09]  You win.
[00:36:11 -> 00:36:12]  I'll drop it.
[00:36:22 -> 00:36:24]  I mean, we need money for...
[00:36:24 -> 00:36:25]  That's two weeks.
[00:36:25 -> 00:36:27]  However long we're going to be out there, right?
[00:36:27 -> 00:36:29]  We need to buy supplies.
[00:36:30 -> 00:36:31]  We need to buy...
[00:36:31 -> 00:36:33]  We might need passage.
[00:36:33 -> 00:36:34]  Pay for passage.
[00:36:34 -> 00:36:36]  We might need who knows what.
[00:36:36 -> 00:36:40]  And these things can become expensive
[00:36:40 -> 00:36:41]  when you're out on the road.
[00:36:41 -> 00:36:43]  Especially with a party of this many people.
[00:36:45 -> 00:36:45]  That's all.
[00:36:59 -> 00:36:59]  I mean, we will
[00:36:59 -> 00:37:02]  to the best of our ability that we can.
[00:37:03 -> 00:37:04]  But there are other things.
[00:37:04 -> 00:37:05]  Let's say
[00:37:05 -> 00:37:08]  we need passage.
[00:37:08 -> 00:37:10]  That's really the big one that comes to mind.
[00:37:10 -> 00:37:13]  To get places, you need to spend money.
[00:37:14 -> 00:37:15]  And that can become expensive.
[00:37:16 -> 00:37:18]  And it's not five gold here,
[00:37:18 -> 00:37:19]  five gold there
[00:37:19 -> 00:37:21]  that's going to make things happen.
[00:37:21 -> 00:37:23]  Anyways, I'm speaking in...
[00:37:24 -> 00:37:28]  Yeah, I'm just making stuff up at this point.
[00:37:29 -> 00:37:30]  We have not left yet.
[00:37:30 -> 00:37:32]  So let's just drop it
[00:37:32 -> 00:37:36]  and we'll take it as it comes.
[00:37:39 -> 00:37:39]  We'll be fine.
[00:37:54 -> 00:37:55]  Do we have potions?
[00:37:55 -> 00:37:56]  Do we have...
[00:37:56 -> 00:37:58]  Well, no, we actually have spells we don't need.
[00:37:59 -> 00:38:00]  This time around, we actually have...
[00:38:00 -> 00:38:02]  I've got cure wounds.
[00:38:02 -> 00:38:03]  Wow.
[00:38:07 -> 00:38:10]  We can heal.
[00:38:11 -> 00:38:13]  Yeah, we learned...
[00:38:14 -> 00:38:15]  We overcompensated.
[00:38:19 -> 00:38:19]  Yeah, it's true.
[00:38:21 -> 00:38:22]  I think we're good to go.
[00:38:23 -> 00:38:24]  So, like, what, like, a rest?
[00:38:24 -> 00:38:25]  Do we think we should just go to bed?
[00:38:25 -> 00:38:26]  Early.
[00:38:42 -> 00:39:05]  Yeah, I'm on the horse.
[00:39:05 -> 00:39:07]  I'm not in the carriage.
[00:39:18 -> 00:39:19]  It's up to all y'all.
[00:39:19 -> 00:39:19]  Yeah.
[00:39:20 -> 00:39:22]  Who's the driver?
[00:39:22 -> 00:39:23]  One of you.
[00:39:25 -> 00:39:26]  Perfect.
[00:39:26 -> 00:39:27]  I'm cool with it.
[00:39:30 -> 00:39:31]  Oh, goddammit.
[00:39:32 -> 00:39:35]  I'm actually...
[00:39:35 -> 00:39:36]  I got a bonus, too.
[00:39:37 -> 00:39:37]  What'd I get?
[00:39:38 -> 00:39:39]  I got a 12.
[00:40:04 -> 00:40:05]  Yeah.
[00:40:05 -> 00:40:14]  I gotta put the work in.
[00:40:17 -> 00:40:18]  Yeah, just a little work.
[00:40:18 -> 00:40:19]  Yeah, I get it.
[00:40:20 -> 00:40:21]  All right.
[00:45:53 -> 00:45:55]  Understatement of the campaign.
[00:46:01 -> 00:59:39]  Oh, you can't hear me.
[00:59:39 -> 00:59:40]  Sorry, I was double muted.
[00:59:41 -> 00:59:43]  No, Nyx is by the fire.
[00:59:43 -> 00:59:44]  Like, just hasn't said anything.
[00:59:45 -> 00:59:47]  He's just, like, you know, watching.
[00:59:47 -> 00:59:50]  And then as she says the name, he just leans in.
[00:59:51 -> 00:59:53]  Leans in to hear the name.
[00:59:54 -> 01:00:05]  Yeah, it's like...
[01:00:05 -> 01:00:07]  Would I have known who this is?
[01:00:07 -> 01:00:08]  Would Nyx have known?
[01:00:10 -> 01:00:11]  Okay, okay.
[01:00:19 -> 01:00:20]  Okay, okay.
[01:00:28 -> 01:00:47]  Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
[01:01:27 -> 01:01:27]  Come along.
[01:01:42 -> 01:01:42]  Yeah.
[01:01:53 -> 01:02:33]  A little...
[01:02:33 -> 01:02:34]  It's not from Demon Child.
[01:02:39 -> 01:02:40]  It's the big bad.
[01:02:41 -> 01:02:42]  Like, we...
[01:02:42 -> 01:02:43]  The origin.
[01:02:43 -> 01:02:43]  The origin.
[01:02:45 -> 01:02:45]  Yeah.
[01:02:57 -> 01:02:59]  Have we seen the face of the baby?
[01:03:00 -> 01:03:03]  Has any...
[01:03:03 -> 01:03:05]  Okay, because I was...
[01:03:05 -> 01:03:08]  I was...
[01:03:08 -> 01:03:09]  Yeah.
[01:03:26 -> 01:03:27]  I mean, I...
[01:03:27 -> 01:03:35]  Nyx would passively be trying to see what he can about them without bothering her.
[01:03:35 -> 01:03:42]  So I'm happy to roll whatever, Bobby, to be passive on this and not draw attention.
[01:03:44 -> 01:03:45]  What do you want me to roll?
[01:03:45 -> 01:03:56]  I want to know if the story she's telling...
[01:03:57 -> 01:03:58]  makes sense.
[01:04:00 -> 01:04:02]  I just want to figure out anything.
[01:04:02 -> 01:04:05]  Any information about where she's from.
[01:04:06 -> 01:04:08]  Like, truth.
[01:04:15 -> 01:04:15]  Yeah.
[01:04:16 -> 01:04:16]  To the best.
[01:04:16 -> 01:04:21]  I know it's impossible without asking to get a real, real answer.
[01:04:21 -> 01:04:22]  You know, actually, no.
[01:04:22 -> 01:04:23]  I take that back.
[01:04:23 -> 01:04:24]  Sorry, I'm thinking this through.
[01:04:25 -> 01:04:29]  Nyx would want to know if she's a threat or not.
[01:04:29 -> 01:04:32]  I think that's the most important thing.
[01:04:32 -> 01:04:33]  Not her soul.
[01:04:33 -> 01:04:34]  Yeah.
[01:04:36 -> 01:04:37]  Yeah.
[01:04:46 -> 01:04:47]  Everyone else is, like, being nice to her.
[01:04:47 -> 01:04:49]  I'm like, is she gonna...
[01:04:49 -> 01:04:51]  All right.
[01:04:53 -> 01:04:55]  I'm a minus one investigation.
[01:04:56 -> 01:04:57]  It's not too bad.
[01:04:58 -> 01:04:58]  14.
[01:04:59 -> 01:04:59]  14.
[01:05:49 -> 01:05:50]  No.
[01:05:50 -> 01:05:51]  Thank you.
[01:05:51 -> 01:05:51]  No.
[01:05:55 -> 01:05:56]  Yeah.
[01:06:04 -> 01:06:05]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:06:16 -> 01:06:17]  Okay.
[01:06:23 -> 01:06:24]  Uh-huh.
[01:06:26 -> 01:06:26]  Mm-hmm.
[01:06:46 -> 01:06:47]  No, of course.
[01:06:56 -> 01:06:58]  I'm on the other side.
[01:06:58 -> 01:07:00]  If we're imagining...
[01:07:00 -> 01:07:06]  I'm imagining a campfire with, like, everybody around the campfire on, like, logs or whatever.
[01:07:07 -> 01:07:10]  I'm on the opposite side of the woman.
[01:07:10 -> 01:07:11]  I would have...
[01:07:11 -> 01:07:11]  So that I could see...
[01:07:12 -> 01:07:14]  Oh, but...
[01:07:15 -> 01:07:16]  Oh.
[01:07:16 -> 01:07:16]  Yeah.
[01:07:16 -> 01:07:17]  Yeah.
[01:07:23 -> 01:07:24]  Yeah.
[01:07:25 -> 01:08:37]  Okay.
[01:08:37 -> 01:08:39]  So just to be...
[01:08:39 -> 01:08:40]  I just want to make sure that I...
[01:08:40 -> 01:08:42]  Repeating what you said before.
[01:08:42 -> 01:08:47]  So I have realized that this is...
[01:08:47 -> 01:08:48]  Can you just repeat what I...
[01:08:48 -> 01:08:49]  What did I identify?
[01:08:49 -> 01:09:23]  Mm-hmm.
[01:09:23 -> 01:09:23]  Okay.
[01:09:24 -> 01:09:24]  I understand.
[01:09:25 -> 01:09:25]  Yep.
[01:09:26 -> 01:09:36]  So I take out very slowly, gently.
[01:09:37 -> 01:09:39]  I take out my crossbow.
[01:09:42 -> 01:09:43]  Very gently.
[01:09:43 -> 01:09:44]  I'll put it on my lap.
[01:09:44 -> 01:09:45]  I don't point it.
[01:09:46 -> 01:09:48]  And I put a bow.
[01:09:48 -> 01:09:51]  I'm just, like, playing around with it a little bit.
[01:09:51 -> 01:09:52]  Just kind of, like, looking at it.
[01:09:52 -> 01:09:53]  It's, you know...
[01:09:53 -> 01:09:54]  I'm maintaining it.
[01:09:54 -> 01:09:56]  And I put a bolt on.
[01:09:56 -> 01:09:57]  And I slowly...
[01:09:58 -> 01:09:59]  I'm just...
[01:09:59 -> 01:10:03]  No, like, you take it and you're just, like, you know, I'm pulling it out, right?
[01:10:03 -> 01:10:03]  I'm casual.
[01:10:04 -> 01:10:04]  I'm very casual.
[01:10:05 -> 01:10:07]  I'm pretending I'm, like, maintaining it.
[01:10:07 -> 01:10:07]  Yeah?
[01:10:08 -> 01:10:08]  Right?
[01:10:08 -> 01:10:09]  A little bit.
[01:10:09 -> 01:10:13]  And then I point it at the woman gently.
[01:10:13 -> 01:10:15]  And I say...
[01:10:15 -> 01:10:17]  Very slowly, I point it.
[01:10:17 -> 01:10:18]  And I rest it on my lap.
[01:10:18 -> 01:10:20]  But it's, like, on them.
[01:10:21 -> 01:10:23]  And before anyone says anything, I go...
[01:10:24 -> 01:10:25]  You are in disguise.
[01:10:26 -> 01:10:27]  And you are lying.
[01:10:28 -> 01:10:28]  To us.
[01:10:29 -> 01:10:32]  And I know that you are like me.
[01:10:34 -> 01:10:34]  Okay?
[01:10:34 -> 01:10:36]  You're a bounty hunter just like me.
[01:10:37 -> 01:10:38]  So how about we drop the act?
[01:10:40 -> 01:10:42]  And you show us who you really are.
[01:10:52 -> 01:10:53]  Yeah, click on the...
[01:10:53 -> 01:10:56]  So, Matt, like, yeah, click on the link.
[01:11:08 -> 01:11:09]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:11:21 -> 01:11:25]  That's the concern that I have is that it's real.
[01:11:26 -> 01:11:26]  I'm...
[01:11:26 -> 01:11:27]  Yeah.
[01:11:27 -> 01:11:28]  No, I'm sure that it's real.
[01:11:29 -> 01:11:37]  Right.
[01:11:37 -> 01:11:37]  Yeah.
[01:11:54 -> 01:11:55]  Okay.
[01:11:55 -> 01:12:38]  All of us?
[01:12:52 -> 01:12:53]  I got a 14.
[01:12:57 -> 01:12:58]  Ooh!
[01:12:58 -> 01:12:59]  Dirty 20.
[01:12:59 -> 01:13:03]  21.
[01:13:06 -> 01:13:07]  Ooh!
[01:13:28 -> 01:13:28]  Ongoing...
[01:13:28 -> 01:13:30]  Wow, it's been a while.
[01:13:33 -> 01:13:37]  Let's do...
[01:13:37 -> 01:13:37]  Yeah.
[01:13:37 -> 01:13:40]  So I'm going to attack...
[01:13:40 -> 01:13:43]  I'm going to do a dreadful...
[01:13:43 -> 01:13:44]  I'm going to attack with my crossbow.
[01:13:44 -> 01:13:46]  And I'm going to do a dreadful strike.
[01:13:46 -> 01:13:48]  And that is once per turn.
[01:13:48 -> 01:13:49]  When you attack...
[01:13:49 -> 01:13:50]  I can do this twice.
[01:13:50 -> 01:13:53]  But when you attack a creature and hit it with your weapon,
[01:13:53 -> 01:13:56]  you deal an extra 2d6 psychic damage.
[01:13:57 -> 01:13:59]  And you can do it two times per long rest.
[01:13:59 -> 01:14:00]  So I'm going to do that once.
[01:14:00 -> 01:14:03]  And I also have Vex.
[01:14:04 -> 01:14:04]  Yeah.
[01:14:05 -> 01:14:06]  I'm just saying...
[01:14:06 -> 01:14:07]  Because I'm weird.
[01:14:07 -> 01:14:10]  And if I hit a creature with my hand crossbow,
[01:14:10 -> 01:14:11]  which is what I'm using,
[01:14:12 -> 01:14:13]  and you deal damage to it,
[01:14:13 -> 01:14:15]  you have advantage to your next attack roll
[01:14:15 -> 01:14:18]  against the creature before the end of your next turn.
[01:14:18 -> 01:14:20]  So now I'm just going to attack.
[01:14:20 -> 01:14:21]  I think that's all I can do.
[01:14:25 -> 01:14:25]  Okay.
[01:14:25 -> 01:14:25]  Yeah.
[01:14:26 -> 01:14:26]  Okay.
[01:14:27 -> 01:14:28]  So we're going to go with...
[01:14:28 -> 01:14:28]  I do hit.
[01:14:31 -> 01:14:32]  I got a 13.
[01:14:34 -> 01:14:35]  Oh, it does not.
[01:14:37 -> 01:14:38]  Ooh.
[01:14:38 -> 01:14:39]  Okay.
[01:14:44 -> 01:14:46]  Anything I can hide behind near me?
[01:14:46 -> 01:14:47]  Let me just see.
[01:14:47 -> 01:14:48]  Let me look at the map.
[01:14:54 -> 01:14:54]  I'll do it.
[01:14:58 -> 01:14:58]  Okay.
[01:14:59 -> 01:14:59]  Yeah.
[01:14:59 -> 01:15:14]  Let me go back to...
[01:15:14 -> 01:15:16]  I'm going to go over here.
[01:16:27 -> 01:16:28]  Brutal.
[01:16:40 -> 01:16:41]  Ooh.
[01:16:41 -> 01:16:51]  That's cool.
[01:18:12 -> 01:18:12]  Yeah.
[01:18:13 -> 01:23:01]  Yeah.
[01:23:01 -> 01:23:02]  That's what I got, too.
[01:23:02 -> 01:23:03]  I also got a 14.
[01:25:57 -> 01:25:58]  Moonbeam.
[01:35:37 -> 01:36:31]  That's bad.
[01:36:34 -> 01:36:34]  Shit.
[01:36:44 -> 01:36:45]  Kill everything.
[01:37:35 -> 01:37:41]  I'm here.
[01:37:41 -> 01:37:42]  I've been here the whole time.
[01:37:44 -> 01:37:44]  Right.
[01:37:45 -> 01:37:47]  Right out of range.
[01:37:47 -> 01:37:47]  Right out of range of the camera.
[01:37:48 -> 01:37:49]  All right.
[01:37:49 -> 01:37:52]  So I am going to do what I tried to do last time.
[01:37:52 -> 01:37:52]  Okay.
[01:37:52 -> 01:37:54]  So let me just...
[01:37:54 -> 01:37:55]  I'm going to attack with my crossbow.
[01:37:56 -> 01:37:59]  I've got 30 feet of range, and I'm 15 feet away from her.
[01:37:59 -> 01:38:01]  I did the thing already.
[01:38:02 -> 01:38:03]  Yeah.
[01:38:03 -> 01:38:03]  I'm going to...
[01:38:03 -> 01:38:05]  Let's do that, and then I'll...
[01:38:05 -> 01:38:06]  Let me hit...
[01:38:06 -> 01:38:07]  See if I hit.
[01:38:08 -> 01:38:10]  Does a 25 hit?
[01:38:13 -> 01:38:13]  Oh, yeah.
[01:38:14 -> 01:38:14]  All right.
[01:38:15 -> 01:38:15]  Revenge.
[01:38:16 -> 01:38:18]  So I'm going to do that dreadful...
[01:38:18 -> 01:38:22]  Dreadful strike, and then...
[01:38:22 -> 01:38:25]  And vex, but vex is automatic.
[01:38:27 -> 01:38:28]  So what do I do?
[01:38:29 -> 01:38:30]  How do I do this?
[01:38:30 -> 01:38:32]  It's an extra 2d psychic.
[01:38:32 -> 01:38:34]  So let me...
[01:38:34 -> 01:38:36]  Does it do it automatically?
[01:38:36 -> 01:38:37]  Did it add...
[01:38:38 -> 01:38:39]  I don't know if it added it.
[01:38:39 -> 01:38:40]  I don't think so.
[01:38:40 -> 01:38:42]  Oh, I have to do dreadful strike separately.
[01:38:42 -> 01:38:42]  Okay.
[01:38:43 -> 01:38:43]  I see.
[01:38:43 -> 01:38:43]  Okay.
[01:38:44 -> 01:38:46]  So I'm going for damage for the crossbow.
[01:38:46 -> 01:38:47]  Sorry.
[01:38:47 -> 01:38:48]  This is the first time I've done this.
[01:38:48 -> 01:38:50]  It's been a while.
[01:38:52 -> 01:38:53]  God damn it.
[01:38:54 -> 01:38:55]  Four points of damage.
[01:38:55 -> 01:38:55]  Okay.
[01:38:56 -> 01:38:58]  And then dreadful strike.
[01:39:00 -> 01:39:02]  Seven points of damage.
[01:39:08 -> 01:39:08]  Yeah.
[01:39:12 -> 01:39:13]  That was really bad.
[01:39:15 -> 01:39:17]  And I...
[01:39:17 -> 01:39:18]  But I...
[01:39:18 -> 01:39:23]  Yeah, and I have advantage on my next attack roll against a creature before the end of my next turn.
[01:39:24 -> 01:39:25]  Okay.
[01:39:30 -> 01:39:31]  It's if I hit the creature.
[01:39:31 -> 01:39:33]  If I hit the creature.
[01:39:44 -> 01:39:44]  Yeah.
[01:39:47 -> 01:39:47]  Yeah.
[01:39:50 -> 01:39:51]  You...
[01:39:51 -> 01:39:52]  I think I can.
[01:40:02 -> 01:40:04]  Which is where I'm going, but...
[01:40:04 -> 01:40:05]  Not...
[01:40:05 -> 01:40:10]  I forgot.
[01:40:12 -> 01:40:15]  Can I cast it even though I've already attacked?
[01:40:15 -> 01:40:16]  Can I do bonus...
[01:40:16 -> 01:40:18]  Is it a bonus action?
[01:40:19 -> 01:40:20]  I can, actually.
[01:40:21 -> 01:40:21]  All right.
[01:40:21 -> 01:40:23]  I will cast Hunter's Mark.
[01:40:23 -> 01:40:24]  I know, but I've already...
[01:40:25 -> 01:40:25]  Be fair.
[01:40:26 -> 01:40:27]  I already attacked.
[01:40:27 -> 01:40:29]  But I will throw Caster's Mark on top of that.
[01:40:30 -> 01:40:35]  And I do...
[01:40:35 -> 01:40:36]  I do have that under bonus action.
[01:40:39 -> 01:40:39]  No.
[01:40:40 -> 01:40:41]  Is it actually damage?
[01:40:42 -> 01:40:43]  Oh, it is damage.
[01:40:43 -> 01:40:43]  Yeah.
[01:40:46 -> 01:40:47]  Yeah.
[01:40:47 -> 01:40:49]  And it's a bonus action.
[01:40:54 -> 01:40:55]  Okay.
[01:40:55 -> 01:40:58]  So I will all roll, I guess, for Hunter's Mark.
[01:40:58 -> 01:40:58]  Thank you.
[01:41:03 -> 01:41:04]  Oh, thank you.
[01:41:05 -> 01:41:06]  Thank you.
[01:41:06 -> 01:41:07]  That's a three.
[01:41:13 -> 01:41:14]  So an extra three.
[01:41:19 -> 01:41:21]  I stay hidden at this point.
[01:41:21 -> 01:41:22]  I duck back down.
[01:41:31 -> 01:41:32]  You did this wrong.
[01:41:46 -> 01:41:47]  Wait.
[01:41:47 -> 01:41:47]  Hang on.
[01:41:50 -> 01:41:50]  We are...
[01:41:50 -> 01:41:50]  We are...
[01:41:50 -> 01:41:52]  We're also level, what, three?
[01:41:53 -> 01:41:54]  Like, we...
[01:41:54 -> 01:41:54]  Yeah.
[01:41:54 -> 01:41:58]  I had, like, 25 spells to pick from each time.
[01:41:58 -> 01:41:59]  Like, at the end.
[01:41:59 -> 01:42:00]  Last campaign.
[01:42:00 -> 01:42:00]  Yeah.
[01:42:00 -> 01:42:01]  Bobby's right.
[01:42:11 -> 01:42:16]  Yeah.
[01:42:32 -> 01:42:33]  Yep.
[01:42:36 -> 01:42:37]  Yep.
[01:43:55 -> 01:43:56]  I love...
[01:43:56 -> 01:43:58]  I love how you decided that for her.
[01:44:01 -> 01:44:02]  Before she's...
[01:44:02 -> 01:44:02]  Yeah.
[01:44:04 -> 01:44:16]  Oh, goddammit.
[01:44:18 -> 01:44:18]  Goddammit.
[01:44:18 -> 01:44:18]  Oh, goddammit.
[01:45:28 -> 01:45:30]  Obvious turning into barony.
[01:45:48 -> 01:45:49]  Hang on.
[01:45:49 -> 01:45:50]  Let me see on my end.
[01:45:50 -> 01:45:59]  What do I...
[01:45:59 -> 01:46:00]  I don't actually see...
[01:46:01 -> 01:46:02]  Oh, I do see 13 to heal.
[01:46:02 -> 01:46:02]  Yeah.
[01:46:03 -> 01:46:03]  I see 13.
[01:46:35 -> 01:46:35]  Yep.
[01:55:05 -> 01:55:07]  Oh, my god.
[01:55:07 -> 01:55:08]  I got a five.
[01:55:08 -> 01:55:09]  What the fuck?
[01:55:36 -> 01:55:36]  What...
[01:55:36 -> 01:55:37]  What does blind do again?
[01:55:39 -> 01:55:40]  Mechanical.
[01:55:50 -> 01:55:51]  Okay.
[01:55:51 -> 01:55:53]  But I can still attack.
[01:56:00 -> 01:56:04]  I'm just saying, is it an auto fail or is it disadvantage?
[01:56:04 -> 01:56:06]  Got it.
[01:56:07 -> 01:56:09]  With my advantage.
[01:56:09 -> 01:56:10]  So it just cancels out.
[01:56:16 -> 01:56:19]  No, I have advantage in my next turn because...
[01:56:21 -> 01:56:53]  It's a flashbang.
[01:56:53 -> 01:56:54]  Okay.
[01:57:10 -> 01:57:10]  Yeah.
[01:57:11 -> 01:57:16]  So as I was saying before, when I cast Hunter's Mark...
[01:57:17 -> 01:57:19]  No, not Hunter's Mark.
[01:57:19 -> 01:57:21]  It was Vex.
[01:57:21 -> 01:57:23]  So I'm going to read Vex again.
[01:57:23 -> 01:57:24]  If you hit...
[01:57:24 -> 01:57:25]  It's from last turn.
[01:57:25 -> 01:57:27]  If you hit a creature with a hand...
[01:57:27 -> 01:57:33]  Hand crossbow and deal damage to it, which I did, you have advantage on your next attack
[01:57:33 -> 01:57:36]  roll against the creature before the end of your next turn.
[01:57:37 -> 01:57:42]  So according to what you said, correct me if I'm wrong, so I have advantage right now
[01:57:42 -> 01:57:43]  for my attack.
[01:57:44 -> 01:57:45]  And I also have disadvantage.
[01:57:46 -> 01:57:46]  So what happens?
[01:57:47 -> 01:57:48]  Flat.
[01:57:48 -> 01:57:48]  Okay.
[01:57:48 -> 01:57:48]  Cool.
[01:57:49 -> 01:57:49]  All right.
[01:57:49 -> 01:57:50]  I'm going to do that.
[01:57:50 -> 01:57:53]  I'm going to attack with my crossbow.
[01:57:54 -> 01:57:54]  Um...
[01:57:54 -> 01:57:55]  And...
[01:57:56 -> 01:57:56]  I'm going...
[01:57:57 -> 01:57:57]  I'm going to...
[01:57:57 -> 01:57:58]  Uh...
[01:57:58 -> 01:57:59]  Yeah.
[01:57:59 -> 01:57:59]  I'm just going to roll flat.
[01:58:00 -> 01:58:00]  I'm not going to...
[01:58:00 -> 01:58:04]  What?
[01:58:10 -> 01:58:11]  Oh my god.
[01:58:11 -> 01:58:12]  Wait.
[01:58:12 -> 01:58:13]  Let me look at the map.
[01:58:14 -> 01:58:15]  There you go.
[01:58:16 -> 01:58:16]  Um...
[01:58:16 -> 01:58:18]  I don't have that skill yet.
[01:58:18 -> 01:58:18]  I can't...
[01:58:18 -> 01:58:20]  I don't have doppelganger or whatever.
[01:58:20 -> 01:58:21]  It's...
[01:58:21 -> 01:58:22]  I don't even think I can do that.
[01:58:22 -> 01:58:23]  But anyways.
[01:58:23 -> 01:58:23]  Um...
[01:58:23 -> 01:58:24]  Let me roll.
[01:58:29 -> 01:58:30]  There's a 26 hit.
[01:58:39 -> 01:58:41]  Nine points of damage.
[01:58:47 -> 01:58:48]  Well, so...
[01:58:48 -> 01:58:49]  So...
[01:58:49 -> 01:58:49]  Pause.
[01:58:49 -> 01:58:50]  One second.
[01:58:50 -> 01:58:51]  So I want to be fair.
[01:58:52 -> 01:58:52]  Like...
[01:58:52 -> 01:58:56]  I could use Hunter's Mark as a bonus action.
[01:58:57 -> 01:59:02]  Um...
[01:59:02 -> 01:59:03]  It's a bonus action.
[01:59:03 -> 01:59:04]  It's a bonus action.
[01:59:04 -> 01:59:05]  So I can do it afterwards, right?
[01:59:15 -> 01:59:17]  Favored enemy Hunter's Mark.
[01:59:17 -> 01:59:19]  It's under bonus action.
[01:59:20 -> 01:59:21]  Uh...
[01:59:21 -> 01:59:21]  You...
[01:59:21 -> 01:59:21]  Oh!
[01:59:22 -> 01:59:22]  You always...
[01:59:22 -> 01:59:23]  Let me read it.
[01:59:23 -> 01:59:25]  You always have...
[01:59:25 -> 01:59:38]  Okay.
[01:59:39 -> 01:59:48]  Okay.
[01:59:50 -> 01:59:51]  Okay.
[01:59:51 -> 01:59:51]  Okay.
[01:59:54 -> 01:59:55]  Got a 10.
[01:59:55 -> 01:59:56]  Me to beat it.
[01:59:56 -> 01:59:56]  Okay.
[02:00:00 -> 02:00:01]  So I just roll for it.
[02:00:04 -> 02:00:05]  Oof.
[02:00:05 -> 02:00:08]  That's...
[02:00:08 -> 02:00:14]  Six points of damage.
[02:00:15 -> 02:00:16]  And that's out of a d6.
[02:00:17 -> 02:00:22]  So...
[02:00:22 -> 02:00:22]  The Vex?
[02:00:22 -> 02:00:23]  The Vex is automatic.
[02:00:27 -> 02:00:28]  Um...
[02:00:28 -> 02:00:29]  It's an actual...
[02:00:29 -> 02:00:30]  It's an actual...
[02:00:31 -> 02:00:32]  Wait.
[02:00:35 -> 02:00:36]  Can I...
[02:00:36 -> 02:00:37]  I think I can do it.
[02:00:37 -> 02:00:40]  You have mastered the art of fearsome ambushes.
[02:00:40 -> 02:00:45]  Oh, I see.
[02:00:45 -> 02:00:46]  Okay.
[02:00:46 -> 02:00:46]  So let me just read it.
[02:00:46 -> 02:00:49]  When you attack a creature and hit it with a weapon,
[02:00:50 -> 02:00:53]  you can deal an extra 2d6 psychic damage.
[02:00:53 -> 02:00:54]  You can use this benefit...
[02:00:54 -> 02:00:56]  Only once per turn.
[02:00:56 -> 02:00:58]  And you can use it a number of times.
[02:00:58 -> 02:01:00]  Equal the wisdom modifier.
[02:01:00 -> 02:01:01]  Um...
[02:01:01 -> 02:01:06]  And regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
[02:01:06 -> 02:01:08]  I think I can only do it...
[02:01:08 -> 02:01:09]  Uh...
[02:01:09 -> 02:01:12]  No, actually.
[02:01:12 -> 02:01:13]  I have no limit on it.
[02:01:16 -> 02:01:16]  Yeah.
[02:01:17 -> 02:01:17]  Okay.
[02:01:17 -> 02:01:18]  Twice per...
[02:01:18 -> 02:01:19]  Dread VA.
[02:01:19 -> 02:01:19]  You're right.
[02:01:19 -> 02:01:20]  You're right.
[02:01:20 -> 02:01:20]  And I've already used it once.
[02:01:20 -> 02:01:21]  All right.
[02:01:21 -> 02:01:22]  I'll use it one more time.
[02:01:22 -> 02:01:23]  And then I'm done.
[02:01:24 -> 02:01:24]  Okay.
[02:01:24 -> 02:01:26]  So let me just roll.
[02:01:26 -> 02:01:28]  Not bad.
[02:01:28 -> 02:01:29]  Not bad.
[02:01:29 -> 02:01:29]  Seven.
[02:01:34 -> 02:01:34]  Sorry, guys.
[02:01:34 -> 02:01:35]  Just getting used to this.
[02:01:35 -> 02:01:36]  So thank you.
[02:01:42 -> 02:01:43]  I maxed it out.
[02:01:43 -> 02:01:44]  I clicked both.
[02:01:44 -> 02:01:44]  Yep.
[02:01:47 -> 02:01:47]  And I stay hidden.
[02:02:13 -> 02:02:13]  Fifteen.
[02:04:29 -> 02:04:30]  Bobby, are we still...
[02:04:30 -> 02:04:32]  Is Alara, Witty, and I...
[02:04:32 -> 02:04:34]  Are we still blinded?
[02:04:41 -> 02:04:42]  Yeah, it was one or two turns.
[02:04:48 -> 02:04:49]  Uh, she hasn't gone yet.
[02:04:49 -> 02:04:50]  We're still blinded.
[02:04:50 -> 02:04:50]  Okay.
[02:05:04 -> 02:06:53]  Yeah.
[02:09:45 -> 02:09:46]  Yeah.
[02:13:57 -> 02:14:35]  Damn.
[02:14:35 -> 02:14:35]  Damn.
[02:14:57 -> 02:14:57]  Yeah.
[02:14:58 -> 02:14:58]  My turn.
[02:14:59 -> 02:15:02]  So, I'm no longer blinded.
[02:15:02 -> 02:15:03]  Fantastic.
[02:15:03 -> 02:15:06]  And you might be happy to hear I'm not, though.
[02:15:07 -> 02:15:10]  I no longer have Dreadful Strike.
[02:15:10 -> 02:15:15]  So, I do have one more Hunter's Mark, but I...
[02:15:15 -> 02:15:16]  And I won't use it.
[02:15:16 -> 02:15:17]  I will use my Hunter's Mark.
[02:15:17 -> 02:15:18]  But first, I need a roll.
[02:15:25 -> 02:15:29]  And I can use it twice without expending a spell slot.
[02:15:29 -> 02:15:30]  I get it.
[02:15:30 -> 02:15:30]  Okay.
[02:15:31 -> 02:15:31]  Good.
[02:15:32 -> 02:15:32]  Got it.
[02:15:33 -> 02:15:34]  That's a whole different story.
[02:15:34 -> 02:15:34]  That's a whole different story.
[02:15:35 -> 02:15:35]  Okay.
[02:15:35 -> 02:15:36]  Cool.
[02:15:38 -> 02:15:42]  I'm going to attack with my crossbow.
[02:15:45 -> 02:15:46]  Eighteen.
[02:15:46 -> 02:15:46]  Hit.
[02:15:52 -> 02:15:53]  Four points of damage.
[02:15:55 -> 02:15:56]  I know.
[02:15:56 -> 02:15:58]  Now I'm going to do the Hunter's Mark.
[02:16:00 -> 02:16:03]  And four points of damage on the Hunter's Mark.
[02:16:03 -> 02:16:04]  I do well on Hunter's Mark.
[02:16:05 -> 02:16:06]  Everything but my attack.
[02:16:09 -> 02:16:10]  No, I'm going to stay hidden.
[02:16:33 -> 02:16:33]  Yeah.
[02:16:47 -> 02:16:48]  Did we skip?
[02:16:49 -> 02:16:49]  Wait, if we look...
[02:16:49 -> 02:16:49]  What?
[02:17:07 -> 02:17:12]  Did I leave my...
[02:17:12 -> 02:17:13]  Oh, I see.
[02:17:13 -> 02:17:13]  Okay.
[02:17:20 -> 02:17:21]  Oh, mon petit chou.
[02:17:21 -> 02:17:23]  Oh, mon petit chou.
[02:17:23 -> 02:17:25]  Mon petit chou-fleur.
[02:17:27 -> 02:17:28]  My little cauliflower.
[02:20:50 -> 02:20:50]  Yep.
[02:20:56 -> 02:20:56]  Right.
[02:21:24 -> 02:21:25]  Yeah.
[02:21:38 -> 02:21:41]  But it would make sense for Witty because it's like...
[02:21:41 -> 02:21:44]  Maybe that's like why he doesn't care about money or any of that stuff.
[02:21:44 -> 02:21:47]  Because your brain literally can't...
[02:21:47 -> 02:21:49]  You can't have that in your brain.
[02:21:49 -> 02:21:51]  It's so full of all this other stuff.
[02:21:51 -> 02:23:10]  Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.
[02:23:11 -> 02:23:11]  Modo.
[02:23:41 -> 02:23:45]  You barbed it away.
[02:24:30 -> 02:24:31]  Here you are.
[02:27:28 -> 02:27:29]  Yay.
[02:27:29 -> 02:27:30]  All right.
[02:27:31 -> 02:27:32]  Uh, same deal.
[02:27:32 -> 02:27:34]  I'm gonna...
[02:27:34 -> 02:27:37]  Let me just double check that lovely map.
[02:27:37 -> 02:27:37]  Okay.
[02:27:38 -> 02:27:39]  Good.
[02:27:39 -> 02:27:40]  Same positioning.
[02:27:41 -> 02:27:44]  Um, I'm going to hit her with...
[02:27:44 -> 02:27:46]  All right.
[02:27:46 -> 02:27:46]  All right.
[02:27:46 -> 02:27:47]  We're going to do that.
[02:27:47 -> 02:27:48]  Lovely.
[02:27:48 -> 02:27:48]  Crossbow.
[02:27:49 -> 02:28:17]  So we're going to start with this. Nat fucking 20. Let's fucking go, baby. Okay. And then I'm going to, I got 11 points of damage plus, oh man, one. So 12 points of damage.
[02:28:17 -> 02:29:08]  Is that automatic? Is that my, yeah. And I got a six. Can I throw a rock at her? For that half point of damage. Yeah, exactly. Okay, perfect. Yeah, no, that's it. That's all I do.
[02:29:08 -> 02:29:37]  Let's go.
[02:29:52 -> 02:30:38]  You're treating us like you just dunked.
[02:30:40 -> 02:30:52]  Yeah. Yeah. She's very dead.
[02:30:52 -> 02:31:33]  Can we search? Nick's searching. Nick's definitely searches the body. Loot that body. Sorry, baby. Good. Now I've got duplicates.
[02:31:50 -> 02:32:06]  Wait, say that again? Not anymore.
[02:32:11 -> 02:32:13]  Yeah. So I tell, I tell everybody.
[02:32:13 -> 02:32:13]  Okay.
[02:32:13 -> 02:32:34]  Who I found. I say, I tell everyone, hey, looks like she was, I mean, I think she thought we were easy marks. That's her last mistake. And she looks like she was also on her way to go after Mary.
[02:32:36 -> 02:32:44]  So, as I said before, you know, just because, you know, I saw that contract on that bulletin means other people saw it too.
[02:32:44 -> 02:32:45]  So this may not be the.
[02:32:46 -> 02:32:53]  This won't, probably won't be the first. It was the first, but probably not the last time that we're going to have this situation. Just a heads up.
[02:33:11 -> 02:33:17]  Nick's just, Nick's looks at you and it's like, was that a compliment? Or was it an insult?
[02:33:20 -> 02:33:23]  Yeah, definitely. I'll take it.
[02:33:24 -> 02:33:25]  I just nod.
[02:33:45 -> 02:33:47]  Sidor, there is no baby.
[02:33:52 -> 02:33:52]  No.
[02:33:52 -> 02:33:56]  There, there, the baby was in.
[02:33:56 -> 02:33:56]  Illusion.
[02:33:58 -> 02:33:59]  It was magic.
[02:33:59 -> 02:34:02]  There was no act. There's no actual baby.
[02:34:03 -> 02:34:10]  It's a spell used to trick people on unsuspecting marks, which this.
[02:34:11 -> 02:34:15]  Bound this killer thought that they'd be able to get us and treat us as marks.
[02:34:16 -> 02:34:25]  Um, yeah, they just used that magic to deceive us so that they can get close to us and then steal our stuff and probably kill us.
[02:34:25 -> 02:34:33]  And I think there is a risk for us, uh, because we're all we're willing to.
[02:34:33 -> 02:34:34]  I mean, I mean, I can't at this.
[02:34:34 -> 02:34:34]  I can't, I can't catch up, but I can't move forward.
[02:34:34 -> 02:34:35]  But you're jumping on something.
[02:34:35 -> 02:34:36]  I can't, I can't catch up.
[02:34:36 -> 02:34:36]  I can't understand.
[02:34:36 -> 02:34:37]  There ishigh you're holding back.
[02:34:39 -> 02:34:39]  Yeah.
[02:34:39 -> 02:34:41]  If there's no walkie talkie, I'm really tired of being a num for the week doing memorandum calls.

[00:00:00 -> 00:00:15]  oh I was like what the fuck is that I saw the pop up first and I'm like who's Craig
[00:00:15 -> 00:00:22]  anyways last we left off finding out that Hilda was going to be attacked and
[00:00:22 -> 00:00:27]  reaching out to Mary and knowing that there are already soldiers of the Grand
[00:00:27 -> 00:00:36]  duke kind of outside the area the party decided to go and gave assistance they
[00:00:36 -> 00:00:41]  were trying to figure out what the best way was there seemed to be some admin
[00:00:41 -> 00:00:48]  admin wanting to fly however it was determined that it would take a little
[00:00:48 -> 00:00:55]  bit too long to get the proper vehicle as it would be custom-made and maybe the
[00:00:55 -> 00:00:57]  funds might not be there who knows
[00:00:57 -> 00:01:02]  they also discussed Nick's discussed his findings previously about the black
[00:01:02 -> 00:01:13]  swan and the hit on Mary's life or more more discreetly put to be disposed so
[00:01:13 -> 00:01:19]  with that the party decided to kind of go a little bit traditional and you know
[00:01:19 -> 00:01:25]  get a wagon and horses kind of putting the airship did original who knows what
[00:01:25 -> 00:01:26]  they were thinking on hold for the next few days
[00:01:26 -> 00:01:42]  for now one would hope as I recall the party was going to meet up at Whitty's
[00:01:42 -> 00:01:49]  house with the horses as they kind of split up and some went to get the horses
[00:01:49 -> 00:01:56]  and I believe also a Laura did have a conversation with Proctor Edward letting
[00:01:56 -> 00:01:58]  letting him know she would be gone by the time the party was ready to go so I
[00:01:58 -> 00:02:05]  I am sure he will be on for a while and he gave her full support as well as a
[00:02:05 -> 00:02:13]  little book to study while she was gone so kind we're at the Whittiest state the
[00:02:13 -> 00:02:21]  Whitaker the Whitman estate as it were I believe everyone has come back you have
[00:02:21 -> 00:02:25]  your horses I think you got three horses at the end didn't did a little deal try
[00:02:25 -> 00:02:27]  that didn't work didn't get a little deal I'll try to get his
[00:02:27 -> 00:02:28]  horse him and let him go in his car but he left in no time it's not that he was
[00:02:28 -> 00:02:41]  finder fees uh nix may be a little upset uh but yeah so it is evening you have horses carriage
[00:02:42 -> 00:03:08]  um it took you a whole day to figure all this out for clarity opened the last session opened
[00:03:08 -> 00:03:14]  in the morning where you had witty kind of wandering the streets nix runs into him
[00:03:14 -> 00:03:21]  brings witty home you spent a good part of the late morning early afternoon and into the afternoon
[00:03:22 -> 00:03:29]  chasing down an airship your personal erica a lot of time was spent on this
[00:03:36 -> 00:03:38]  it was a two-hour quest um
[00:03:51 -> 00:03:53]  honestly you gotta roll with the punch
[00:03:53 -> 00:05:26]  is i just remember andres's searches after just sleep over at witty's i guess or uh if you want
[00:05:26 -> 00:05:32]  we could say before everyone got back you did do that you wanna turn back time for a minute
[00:05:34 -> 00:05:45]  okay so we will um rewind a little who would have been with you just you on your own um
[00:05:47 -> 00:05:47]  i think
[00:05:48 -> 00:06:08]  quick okay yeah so um after um after a little bit of walking uh you went you come across this ornate
[00:06:08 -> 00:06:16]  building uh almost um massive columns in the front with a steeple roof all made of stone
[00:06:17 -> 00:06:26]  um a very um mix of neoclassical and art uh deco kind of design and as you go in massive doors
[00:06:26 -> 00:06:27]  larger than you
[00:06:28 -> 00:06:37]  side, you see gorgeous tiles, bronze works, all that. And there's like, kind of further in,
[00:06:38 -> 00:06:47]  there's like guards at the door, at least two you can see. And there's kind of a few other people
[00:06:47 -> 00:06:57]  there. Kind of, there's a line, and there seems to be one kind of teller of a sort. And yeah,
[00:06:57 -> 00:07:05]  after a bit, you're in line, you know, maybe about 10, 20 minutes later, and he goes,
[00:07:06 -> 00:07:11]  excuse me, it's your turn to go to the teller. And she goes, well, good afternoon, sir.
[00:07:12 -> 00:07:28]  How may I help you? Hold on a moment, I will go and get that ledger. And you see,
[00:07:28 -> 00:07:35]  she steps back in kind of going and she kind of goes to a wall with multiple tomes,
[00:07:35 -> 00:07:38]  and you see her mumbling and kind of alphabetically,
[00:07:38 -> 00:07:43]  with Haker, she pulls up this massive volume, and she's going through it. And she goes,
[00:07:43 -> 00:07:49]  well, I see the last withdrawal was authorized by one Jarvis. He was in your employ.
[00:07:56 -> 00:08:05]  Well, there's a history of, there's a history of withdrawals. There has been a withdrawal of
[00:08:05 -> 00:08:15]  every week, about 200 gold, about two weeks ago.
[00:08:26 -> 00:08:26]  Wow.
[00:08:28 -> 00:08:35]  Here's the thing. It would seem, the withdrawal two weeks ago,
[00:08:36 -> 00:08:39]  he depleted the remainder of the funds.
[00:08:57 -> 00:09:00]  When did he quit? I thought it was two weeks ago.
[00:09:01 -> 00:09:02]  I fucked up.
[00:09:19 -> 00:09:30]  Sir, it is unfortunate. However, clients are responsible for accrediting users and giving them
[00:09:30 -> 00:09:33]  the right to withdraw from the accounts.
[00:09:33 -> 00:09:40]  We are not liable should you revoke, should you not revoke access to the accounts?
[00:09:40 -> 00:09:44]  It is an unfortunate situation. However, there's nothing I can do at the moment,
[00:09:44 -> 00:09:48]  as there is no way for us to know that this was a fraudulent activity.
[00:09:48 -> 00:09:54]  As per our accounts, he is still allowed to withdraw from your account.
[00:09:55 -> 00:10:19]  Okay.
[00:10:20 -> 00:10:28]  So, should your father be the one to pull out a loan?
[00:10:28 -> 00:10:35]  i would need his presence um here um there are many nobles who use their parents names to pull
[00:10:35 -> 00:10:42]  out loans and we have seen it in our best practice to ensure that those parental figures are here in
[00:10:42 -> 00:10:57]  person to do such withdrawals um so we will gladly give you a loan once your father um appears why
[00:10:57 -> 00:12:48]  not yeah yeah uh yeah go for it describe well it's a cantrip it's a cantrip so it doesn't even
[00:12:48 -> 00:13:53]  spell slot um just describe what this little effigy of your father looks like yeah you can
[00:13:55 -> 00:13:56]  you can do it um
[00:14:00 -> 00:14:06]  so you cast aside self um roll a deception
[00:14:18 -> 00:14:24]  i have nothing on my bingo card 90 percent of the time what you y'all do yeah so 11 okay cool
[00:14:28 -> 00:14:36]  um you see like um i'll say because din no shade to you you just never kind of met
[00:14:37 -> 00:14:43]  um witty's father before right so you got all the major within 11 you got all the major parts right
[00:14:44 -> 00:14:50]  like you know it is very the essence but like if you look like if you looked at the
[00:14:51 -> 00:14:57]  first page in the book it's a fact that you're going to have uh like you'll be a little bit
[00:14:57 -> 00:15:00]  off if you're gonna get an illusion versus that maybe there is a
[00:15:15 -> 00:15:45]  little bit off right but hey who else knows what he looks like except for witty here
[00:15:47 -> 00:18:02]  what is his first name oh my god oh interesting i i love how unhappy my family is
[00:18:02 -> 00:18:05]  oh it's like opalescent i'm loving this color lore
[00:18:06 -> 00:18:09]  there's no bathroom in the bank
[00:18:09 -> 00:18:52]  uh lord whitman i assume oh i see yes he didn't meant to say uh you were just outside i'm glad
[00:18:52 -> 00:18:57]  he was able to find you well before we approve this loan we just need to ensure no counterfeits
[00:18:57 -> 00:19:05]  as you know um there's been a lot of use of magic and such in these cases a lot of young nobles
[00:19:05 -> 00:19:12]  down in the luck or spending too much time in gambling halls hiring actors and such to impersonate
[00:19:12 -> 00:19:21]  parental figures to take out more loans um so i would just yes exactly we want to make sure no
[00:19:21 -> 00:19:33]  hooligans um scam us uh yes so uh if you would stand still for a moment um did you i did i am you
[00:19:33 -> 00:19:37]  um something can you just respond first
[00:19:37 -> 00:19:51]  yes uh i i sent you both in the private channel and in uh just a dm yeah sorry
[00:19:51 -> 00:20:37]  yeah yeah yours is empty jim has one no jim has one um um no okay yeah um yeah so they scan
[00:20:37 -> 00:20:40]  and she goes uh like for a second um
[00:20:41 -> 00:20:46]  she she's uh she looks at you and goes
[00:20:46 -> 00:20:59]  she's like oh i see yes yes yes um there was some magic detected however it seems
[00:20:59 -> 00:21:07]  more nobles these days they like to very much um i see the family resemblance but they very
[00:21:07 -> 00:21:12]  much like to kind of put off a little bit more than they are um
[00:21:12 -> 00:21:28]  you know glitz everything up i don't blame you for that well well um now given that your refinements
[00:21:28 -> 00:21:38]  were a little less than honest um and i can see the family resemblance so i'm i'm confident you
[00:21:38 -> 00:21:46]  are his father we will need some liability um you i believe uh your son mentioned a state we can put
[00:21:46 -> 00:22:05]  a lien against the estate if um if if you so wish hey give me a moment uh about five minutes later
[00:22:05 -> 00:22:13]  she comes back with a large stack of papers uh please sign where it's x um just to know um we
[00:22:13 -> 00:22:19]  will be able to give you a 1 000 1000 gold loan um however you do not repay it repay it we will
[00:22:19 -> 00:22:28]  cease possession of your estate um payments start in one month um the payment turns out to be a
[00:22:28 -> 00:22:30]  are...
[00:22:30 -> 00:22:31]  Fuck, I have to do math.
[00:22:39 -> 00:22:40]  Yes.
[00:22:43 -> 00:22:48]  The worst is...
[00:22:48 -> 00:22:51]  Oh, we do have an account
[00:22:51 -> 00:22:53]  for the estate in Bastion City where there
[00:22:53 -> 00:22:55]  was funds from other institutes
[00:22:55 -> 00:22:57]  transferred in. However, there's no
[00:22:57 -> 00:22:58]  more funds, and
[00:22:58 -> 00:23:01]  unless you were going to...
[00:23:01 -> 00:23:02]  Unless you had a certified
[00:23:02 -> 00:23:05]  statement from...
[00:23:05 -> 00:23:07]  I believe from what I see
[00:23:07 -> 00:23:09]  here is from the...
[00:23:09 -> 00:23:11]  Fuck, I'm
[00:23:11 -> 00:23:12]  doubting my own lore.
[00:23:13 -> 00:23:14]  From the
[00:23:14 -> 00:23:17]  Vasilian Banks, unless you have a certified
[00:23:17 -> 00:23:19]  statement from the Vasilian
[00:23:19 -> 00:23:21]  Banks that is
[00:23:21 -> 00:23:23]  encoded magically, I wouldn't
[00:23:23 -> 00:23:25]  be able to put funds in.
[00:23:26 -> 00:23:27]  So the only way within
[00:23:27 -> 00:23:29]  Bastion City and the purview of this bank
[00:23:29 -> 00:23:31]  is to put a lien against
[00:23:31 -> 00:23:32]  your current estate.
[00:23:33 -> 00:23:35]  But I'm sure you'll be able to pay this, correct?
[00:23:35 -> 00:23:51]  Um, hold on.
[00:23:51 -> 00:23:53]  I will have to...
[00:23:53 -> 00:23:55]  We can do a thousand.
[00:23:55 -> 00:23:56]  However, we...
[00:23:56 -> 00:23:59]  For two thousand, we would have to go to City Hall
[00:23:59 -> 00:24:01]  and pull up the records for
[00:24:01 -> 00:24:03]  your estate to evaluate
[00:24:03 -> 00:24:04]  and confirm the value.
[00:24:10 -> 00:24:11]  Uh, one thousand.
[00:24:20 -> 00:24:22]  Um, so it will be starting
[00:24:22 -> 00:24:24]  in a month's time. Um, it will be
[00:24:24 -> 00:24:25]  a hundred gold monthly payment.
[00:24:26 -> 00:24:27]  Um,
[00:24:33 -> 00:24:35]  yes, there is a glass of water.
[00:24:35 -> 00:24:37]  Uh, there is a self-serve,
[00:24:37 -> 00:24:39]  like, little fountain with, like,
[00:24:39 -> 00:24:41]  it's magically iced, like, cold
[00:24:41 -> 00:24:43]  water, little paper cups.
[00:24:44 -> 00:24:44]  Um,
[00:24:44 -> 00:24:51]  yeah,
[00:24:51 -> 00:24:53]  and she's like, so, yes, it will
[00:24:53 -> 00:24:55]  be starting in a month. It will be a hundred
[00:24:55 -> 00:24:57]  gold a month repayment in a ten-month
[00:24:57 -> 00:24:59]  repayment for a thousand gold
[00:24:59 -> 00:25:01]  loan. Uh,
[00:25:01 -> 00:25:03]  failure, uh, in the
[00:25:03 -> 00:25:05]  first month, if you do not pay it, you will owe
[00:25:05 -> 00:25:07]  the total immediately.
[00:25:08 -> 00:25:09]  Unable to pay that total,
[00:25:09 -> 00:25:11]  you will then, we will then,
[00:25:11 -> 00:25:13]  um, take possession of the estate.
[00:25:24 -> 00:25:25]  Oh, this is,
[00:25:26 -> 00:25:27]  um, as I told your son, um,
[00:25:28 -> 00:25:30]  apologies if you did
[00:25:30 -> 00:25:32]  not hear, um, the thousand is
[00:25:32 -> 00:25:34]  just a default kind of loan we
[00:25:34 -> 00:25:35]  do give against any
[00:25:35 -> 00:25:37]  nobility estate. If you would want a
[00:25:37 -> 00:25:40]  larger loan, we will have to, um,
[00:25:40 -> 00:25:42]  work with the city records, um,
[00:25:42 -> 00:25:43]  and look at the evaluation of the
[00:25:43 -> 00:25:45]  estate and fully evaluate it to understand
[00:25:45 -> 00:25:47]  its full value. We cannot
[00:25:47 -> 00:25:50]  guarantee any amount, um,
[00:25:50 -> 00:25:51]  given in that process. It will be,
[00:25:51 -> 00:25:53]  um, determined by, um, our
[00:25:53 -> 00:26:06]  team. Excellent. Um,
[00:26:06 -> 00:26:08]  now, just sign these documents.
[00:26:09 -> 00:26:10]  It's like a big pile of documents.
[00:26:18 -> 00:26:19]  Uh,
[00:26:21 -> 00:26:24]  imagine.
[00:26:27 -> 00:26:28]  Um,
[00:26:29 -> 00:26:29]  as you
[00:26:29 -> 00:26:31]  finish, it goes, most excellent.
[00:26:32 -> 00:26:33]  Um, here is,
[00:26:33 -> 00:26:35]  um, you know, and she kind of, while you're
[00:26:35 -> 00:26:37]  doing that, here is your thousand
[00:26:37 -> 00:26:39]  gold pieces. Um, don't spend
[00:26:39 -> 00:26:41]  it all at once. And, um,
[00:26:41 -> 00:26:43]  we will, yeah, please
[00:26:43 -> 00:26:51]  make your payments. It's like a
[00:26:51 -> 00:26:53]  big bag. Like, you cannot pocket
[00:26:53 -> 00:27:02]  it. Um, yeah,
[00:27:02 -> 00:27:04]  so, yeah, she's
[00:27:04 -> 00:27:07]  got a thousand
[00:27:07 -> 00:27:07]  gold.
[00:27:14 -> 00:27:27]  Oh my god. You know
[00:27:27 -> 00:27:28]  I will.
[00:27:29 -> 00:27:29]  Yes.
[00:28:09 -> 00:28:11]  I can be a big shrug.
[00:28:19 -> 00:28:20]  Oh, yeah.
[00:28:22 -> 00:28:23]  All the
[00:28:23 -> 00:28:40]  money. So,
[00:28:48 -> 00:29:02]  um,
[00:29:02 -> 00:29:03]  uh, and we're back
[00:29:03 -> 00:29:05]  to the evening at the Whittier State.
[00:29:06 -> 00:29:08]  Din has, um,
[00:29:08 -> 00:29:09]  quite the amount on him.
[00:29:10 -> 00:29:12]  Legit, put a thousand gold
[00:29:12 -> 00:29:13]  pieces in your inventory, Din.
[00:29:14 -> 00:29:20]  Um, yeah.
[00:29:21 -> 00:29:30]  I feel like I'm going to have to
[00:29:30 -> 00:29:32]  ride a whole, like, you gotta
[00:29:32 -> 00:29:33]  rest it for fraud.
[00:29:43 -> 00:29:43]  Yeah.
[00:29:46 -> 00:29:46]  Merly,
[00:29:46 -> 00:29:46]  Merly.
[00:29:49 -> 00:29:50]  No, I'd be like,
[00:29:50 -> 00:29:53]  Mark, Mark, what, what are fraud
[00:29:53 -> 00:29:54]  laws in Quebec?
[00:29:58 -> 00:29:59]  You're still a lawyer,
[00:29:59 -> 00:29:59]  Mark.
[00:30:01 -> 00:30:09]  He's so concerned.
[00:30:10 -> 00:30:12]  Um, yeah, so we are in the
[00:30:12 -> 00:30:14]  evening. Um, you know,
[00:30:14 -> 00:30:16]  Din's a thousand dollars richer.
[00:30:17 -> 00:30:17]  Um,
[00:30:18 -> 00:30:18]  I don't think that's appropriate.
[00:30:20 -> 00:30:21]  Um,
[00:30:21 -> 00:30:24]  I mean, Whitty, do you mention that you go
[00:30:24 -> 00:30:25]  to the bank?
[00:31:39 -> 00:31:40]  Exactly.
[00:31:41 -> 00:32:04]  Yeah.
[00:32:04 -> 00:32:08]  Yes, it's not going great.
[00:32:10 -> 00:32:11]  Um,
[00:32:27 -> 00:32:28]  um,
[00:32:38 -> 00:32:39]  I will,
[00:32:39 -> 00:32:42]  okay, you could roll
[00:32:42 -> 00:32:44]  an insight next if you
[00:32:44 -> 00:32:45]  want it to.
[00:32:46 -> 00:32:48]  You have to beat a 19.
[00:32:57 -> 00:32:58]  It is true
[00:32:58 -> 00:32:59]  because he's like,
[00:33:00 -> 00:33:01]  because he's second to it.
[00:33:02 -> 00:33:02]  Does it?
[00:33:02 -> 00:33:03]  Um, yeah.
[00:33:04 -> 00:33:06]  You, for a second, I'll say
[00:33:06 -> 00:33:08]  this next. When Whit says it,
[00:33:08 -> 00:33:10]  you're like, like, when Whitty
[00:33:10 -> 00:33:12]  says it, you're like, you really,
[00:33:12 -> 00:33:14]  you almost want to believe it.
[00:33:14 -> 00:33:16]  Like, almost had you
[00:33:16 -> 00:33:18]  convinced. And then you,
[00:33:18 -> 00:33:20]  then you just think about Whitty's and
[00:33:20 -> 00:33:22]  Din's relationship up till now.
[00:33:58 -> 00:34:01]  What is
[00:34:01 -> 00:34:02]  Barrett enrolling?
[00:34:05 -> 00:34:07]  A deception with disadvantage, 17.
[00:34:09 -> 00:34:10]  Insight,
[00:34:12 -> 00:34:13]  I will say with advantage,
[00:34:14 -> 00:34:15]  just at this point,
[00:34:18 -> 00:34:20]  at this point,
[00:34:20 -> 00:34:24]  like, you know
[00:34:24 -> 00:34:26]  what? Yeah, so,
[00:34:26 -> 00:34:28]  you're like, you can't quite believe
[00:34:28 -> 00:34:30]  it, but then you're like, at this
[00:34:30 -> 00:34:32]  point, like, who knows
[00:34:32 -> 00:34:34]  between what you have
[00:34:34 -> 00:34:36]  seen in their short relationship between
[00:34:36 -> 00:34:37]  Whitty and Din?
[00:34:38 -> 00:34:40]  Like, would it really surprise you if it was
[00:34:40 -> 00:34:42]  $3,000 at the end of the day?
[00:34:42 -> 00:34:44]  3,000 gold at the end of the day?
[00:34:48 -> 00:34:49]  I mean, I'm not, I don't
[00:34:49 -> 00:34:50]  truly hate this.
[00:37:43 -> 00:37:44]  Anything else for
[00:37:44 -> 00:37:44]  the evening?
[00:37:44 -> 00:37:47]  I mean, we,
[00:37:48 -> 00:37:49]  we talked money,
[00:37:49 -> 00:37:52]  people got ready
[00:37:52 -> 00:37:53]  to travel.
[00:37:54 -> 00:37:55]  Anything else?
[00:38:01 -> 00:38:01]  Yes.
[00:38:04 -> 00:38:04]  Wow.
[00:38:05 -> 00:38:09]  For once, some people
[00:38:09 -> 00:38:10]  prepared.
[00:38:16 -> 00:38:17]  I mean,
[00:38:17 -> 00:38:18]  will you?
[00:38:20 -> 00:38:25]  Yeah, so,
[00:38:25 -> 00:38:27]  it's a long rest.
[00:38:28 -> 00:38:29]  Yeah, you
[00:38:29 -> 00:38:31]  have all a nice sleep
[00:38:31 -> 00:38:32]  in the Whittaker estate.
[00:38:33 -> 00:38:37]  It's bright and early
[00:38:37 -> 00:38:39]  in the morning. I assume you guys
[00:38:39 -> 00:38:41]  kind of get up early to get a good head
[00:38:41 -> 00:38:43]  start of your day.
[00:38:44 -> 00:38:45]  The horses,
[00:38:46 -> 00:38:47]  you know, I'll say there is,
[00:38:47 -> 00:38:49]  there was some old feed
[00:38:49 -> 00:38:50]  in the stables
[00:38:50 -> 00:38:53]  that were empty, but, like, where the
[00:38:53 -> 00:38:55]  chariot was, there was some feed there. You're
[00:38:55 -> 00:38:57]  able to, like, feed the horses, take care of
[00:38:57 -> 00:38:59]  them. Anything
[00:38:59 -> 00:39:01]  before
[00:39:01 -> 00:39:02]  you depart, anything?
[00:39:03 -> 00:39:09]  Okay, so, two horses
[00:39:09 -> 00:39:10]  pulling the carriage.
[00:39:10 -> 00:39:13]  Nyx is riding a horse. Who
[00:39:13 -> 00:39:14]  is guiding the carriage?
[00:39:19 -> 00:39:21]  Yeah, who's the driver?
[00:39:27 -> 00:39:27]  Nyx
[00:39:27 -> 00:39:29]  and Ysidor, animal handling.
[00:39:40 -> 00:39:42]  Yeah, you always
[00:39:42 -> 00:39:44]  see, I'll say, for
[00:39:44 -> 00:39:46]  Ysidor, you see him, like, go on
[00:39:46 -> 00:39:48]  and, like, I feel like, Ysidor,
[00:39:48 -> 00:39:50]  from your, like, growing, like, you've
[00:39:50 -> 00:39:52]  done farm work and that, and, like,
[00:39:52 -> 00:39:54]  this is the same, like, very
[00:39:54 -> 00:39:55]  much comfortable, natural,
[00:39:56 -> 00:39:57]  kind of, just getting the horses
[00:39:57 -> 00:40:00]  ready to go. Nyx,
[00:40:02 -> 00:40:03]  the mare's a little bit
[00:40:03 -> 00:40:05]  temperamental. You know, you have to,
[00:40:06 -> 00:40:06]  like,
[00:40:07 -> 00:40:09]  going fine, but you just kind of have
[00:40:09 -> 00:40:11]  to sometimes persuade
[00:40:11 -> 00:40:13]  her a little to listen fully,
[00:40:13 -> 00:40:15]  but, like, yeah,
[00:40:15 -> 00:40:17]  you've got to put a little bit, not a lot,
[00:40:19 -> 00:40:19]  a little work.
[00:40:20 -> 00:40:21]  Yeah, maybe it's been
[00:40:21 -> 00:40:22]  a while since you,
[00:40:22 -> 00:40:25]  but, yeah, you just see Ysidor,
[00:40:25 -> 00:40:27]  like, with,
[00:40:27 -> 00:40:28]  the reins, the horses,
[00:40:29 -> 00:40:31]  giddy up. You're able,
[00:40:31 -> 00:40:33]  as you kind of go across the
[00:40:33 -> 00:40:34]  bridge,
[00:40:34 -> 00:40:37]  you kind of enter the
[00:40:37 -> 00:40:39]  east side of Bastion City. You're
[00:40:39 -> 00:40:41]  following the roads. Remember, there's
[00:40:41 -> 00:40:43]  the light crystal lanterns all
[00:40:43 -> 00:40:45]  on the main road. You
[00:40:45 -> 00:40:47]  go to the guard gates. They're
[00:40:47 -> 00:40:49]  really there more for people coming in than
[00:40:49 -> 00:40:51]  going out. And
[00:40:51 -> 00:40:53]  you see, like, the sleeping,
[00:40:54 -> 00:40:55]  what do you call it,
[00:40:55 -> 00:40:57]  war forges on the
[00:40:57 -> 00:40:57]  side.
[00:40:57 -> 00:40:58]  I deactivate it.
[00:40:59 -> 00:41:01]  And soon out that, you're
[00:41:01 -> 00:41:02]  on the main road.
[00:41:04 -> 00:41:05]  As you kind of
[00:41:05 -> 00:41:07]  are outside the walls of
[00:41:07 -> 00:41:09]  Bastion City, there's still, like, houses
[00:41:09 -> 00:41:11]  and farmlands and that. It's not completely
[00:41:11 -> 00:41:13]  desolate. Like, there is a
[00:41:13 -> 00:41:15]  whole kind of economy outside the city
[00:41:15 -> 00:41:17]  that sustains the city, as this is
[00:41:17 -> 00:41:19]  the capital and that. So, obviously, within
[00:41:19 -> 00:41:20]  city walls, you're not going to have farms.
[00:41:21 -> 00:41:22]  So, I would say,
[00:41:22 -> 00:41:25]  yeah, as you're
[00:41:25 -> 00:41:26]  going,
[00:41:26 -> 00:41:26]  um,
[00:41:27 -> 00:41:29]  you're making good time.
[00:41:29 -> 00:41:31]  Uh, there are, as you go further
[00:41:31 -> 00:41:33]  and further, less people on the road.
[00:41:34 -> 00:41:36]  Um, as the sun goes down
[00:41:36 -> 00:41:38]  and that, uh, there's some obvious
[00:41:38 -> 00:41:40]  spots to make camp. Um,
[00:41:42 -> 00:41:49]  yeah. Um, so,
[00:41:49 -> 00:41:51]  I would say, in the back of the
[00:41:51 -> 00:41:53]  wagon, uh, in the chariot, wait,
[00:41:53 -> 00:41:55]  this is a proper chariot, isn't it?
[00:41:56 -> 00:41:58]  Um, this, yeah, so,
[00:41:58 -> 00:42:01]  I don't know how you're configured, but you would be enclosed.
[00:42:01 -> 00:42:05]  Nice and padded. Um, you, Alara, and Witty
[00:42:05 -> 00:42:11]  in the back. I, I don't know, um, how private of a conversation you'd be able to have,
[00:42:11 -> 00:42:14]  or, um, you could choose to have it when you camp,
[00:42:14 -> 00:42:15]  if you want it to be private.
[00:42:15 -> 00:42:51]  Well, he's the dean, dean of the seminary. He's in charge of the whole seminary.
[00:42:51 -> 00:46:28]  Hold to assume.
[00:46:28 -> 00:48:47]  I will, so, my thing right now to adjudicate, I'm just folding laundry and paying attention,
[00:48:47 -> 00:48:50]  uh, to adjudicate this, is.
[00:48:52 -> 00:48:58]  I will say, you can perform, you can roll your performance check flat- your performance flat,
[00:48:58 -> 00:49:06]  I will allow Alara to determine however she feels about it, it won't be contested for her to believe it.
[00:49:06 -> 00:49:08]  Or not, it's a character.
[00:49:09 -> 00:49:10]  Yep.
[00:49:13 -> 00:49:16]  Yeah, your performance. Your actual performance. Whatever it is.
[00:49:18 -> 00:49:22]  Oh yeah, uh, flat means without advantage or disadvantage.
[00:49:22 -> 00:49:24]  ten
[00:49:24 -> 00:49:28]  the most middle of the road
[00:49:28 -> 00:49:29]  of anything
[00:49:29 -> 00:49:33]  in the middle of the road
[00:49:33 -> 00:49:54]  well you and
[00:49:54 -> 00:49:54]  Justin
[00:49:54 -> 00:51:07]  when you said the lines are going to catch up
[00:51:07 -> 00:51:11]  I feel like y'all are going to forget
[00:51:11 -> 00:51:11]  about it
[00:51:11 -> 00:51:15]  you come back
[00:51:15 -> 00:51:18]  very sweet
[00:51:18 -> 00:51:20]  moment really appreciate
[00:51:20 -> 00:51:22]  that like no like seriously
[00:51:22 -> 00:51:23]  it was
[00:51:23 -> 00:51:26]  you just want to call that out yeah so
[00:51:26 -> 00:51:28]  I guess there's probably an awkward silence
[00:51:28 -> 00:51:30]  in the carriage right now
[00:51:30 -> 00:51:32]  at least between Din and
[00:51:32 -> 00:51:32]  Alara
[00:51:32 -> 00:51:36]  but yeah
[00:51:36 -> 00:51:38]  I'd say your day
[00:51:38 -> 00:51:40]  goes on pretty without events
[00:51:40 -> 00:51:42]  outside of that like really
[00:51:42 -> 00:51:45]  is there
[00:51:45 -> 00:51:48]  while we're running this because a few days are going
[00:51:48 -> 00:51:50]  to go by is there any other conversations people
[00:51:50 -> 00:51:52]  want to have I know
[00:51:52 -> 00:51:54]  Ysidor is going Nick's kind of on
[00:51:54 -> 00:51:55]  their own Ysidor
[00:51:55 -> 00:51:58]  is the one controlling
[00:51:58 -> 00:52:00]  it there is a seat beside Ysidor
[00:52:00 -> 00:52:02]  if anyone want to have a conversation
[00:52:02 -> 00:52:03]  otherwise how are you
[00:52:03 -> 00:52:06]  is there anything particular either
[00:52:06 -> 00:52:08]  when you stop in the evenings or anything
[00:52:08 -> 00:52:09]  you all wanted to do
[00:52:09 -> 00:52:17]  if not it's okay to say no
[00:52:17 -> 00:52:21]  I just didn't want to like railroad
[00:52:21 -> 00:52:23]  I just didn't want to like railroad
[00:52:23 -> 00:52:30]  anything yeah so yeah
[00:52:30 -> 00:52:32]  yeah
[00:52:32 -> 00:52:34]  yeah so
[00:52:34 -> 00:52:38]  yeah I would say about a week has passed
[00:52:38 -> 00:52:41]  as you have kind of gone
[00:52:41 -> 00:52:43]  mountains are coming more and more into
[00:52:43 -> 00:52:45]  sight houses are further and further
[00:52:45 -> 00:52:48]  apart they're still occasionally houses
[00:52:48 -> 00:52:51]  and such
[00:52:51 -> 00:52:53]  I don't say this trip will take two weeks
[00:52:53 -> 00:52:55]  it was there is kind of short cuts you
[00:52:55 -> 00:52:57]  can take by slip that carriage goes to
[00:52:57 -> 00:53:01]  carriage doesn't allow for but like there are the roads kind of getting a little bit worse as you
[00:53:01 -> 00:53:08]  have to turn off i'll say yesor kind of remembers where he went in that um it's getting more wood
[00:53:08 -> 00:53:14]  these uh trees there's more and more trees less farmhouses but you still see occasionally in the
[00:53:14 -> 00:53:20]  distance um you'll see some worn paths from smaller trails and lights in the distance than
[00:53:20 -> 00:53:27]  that as you camp and you're camping one evening you've settled in um probably by now it's that
[00:53:27 -> 00:53:32]  you all have like kind of a ritual kind of you all do right like setting up everything and that
[00:53:32 -> 00:53:40]  um and as you finish eating your evening meals you see uh from just from the shadows you kind
[00:53:40 -> 00:53:47]  of hear like branches breaking and a young lady um comes into kind of the light of your campfire
[00:53:47 -> 00:53:50]  um with a baby
[00:53:50 -> 00:53:50]  on
[00:53:50 -> 00:53:55]  her like as she comes in you see she has kind of that satchel i don't know what the terms are
[00:53:55 -> 00:54:06]  with a baby on her back and goes um hello i saw your fire in the distance i was hoping i could
[00:54:06 -> 00:54:20]  share uh safety and numbers uh i'm i'm sorry uh just i i've been walking the road trying to get

[00:54:51 -> 00:55:05]  of a traveler leaving from bastion city yeah and she comes just down beside you and like
[00:55:05 -> 00:55:10]  she's holding her baby um kind of um the baby has started getting a little upset but she's

[01:05:08 -> 01:05:19]  you realize because you've seen this before this is not her disguise like this is not

[01:06:31 -> 01:06:36]  um pretending you don't know um what you don't suspect what's happening in the campfire

[01:08:04 -> 01:08:48]  okay okay so nix with this realization what do you do a disguise
[01:08:48 -> 01:08:56]  you you realize what you're seeing this young mother woman wearing plain clothes what you
[01:08:56 -> 01:09:04]  actually see is um the color the color of the clothes are actually you realize your reality
[01:09:04 -> 01:09:10]  was distorted by magic um they weren't wearing the shape all the clothes are kind of the same
[01:09:10 -> 01:09:18]  shape but it's a very different outfit and what you see is behind all of that disguise self
[01:09:18 -> 01:09:27]  is another kind of hit person in the same line of view doing a job they're disguised they're not
[01:09:27 -> 01:10:55]  posing any threat at the moment but they have hidden who they are oh so okay click on the link
[01:10:55 -> 01:11:04]  everyone click on the link uh initiative was auto rolled um we have stopped initiative
[01:11:04 -> 01:11:13]  oh yeah i'm waiting is everyone here
[01:11:15 -> 01:11:16]  yeah
[01:11:20 -> 01:11:34]  uh start session so here's the thing nix you had the chance to get a surprise round
[01:11:34 -> 01:11:44]  however you did um if you didn't if you guys didn't they would have gotten um top of combat
[01:11:45 -> 01:11:45]  as you
[01:11:45 -> 01:11:53]  say that they they got 16 initiative like they throw the baby and as they throw the illusion
[01:11:53 -> 01:12:05]  breaks away there wasn't a baby there she goes ah you know i wasn't going to hurt you much
[01:12:05 -> 01:12:11]  you know maybe steal a little bit you know i i figured this was slim picking some easy pickings
[01:12:11 -> 01:12:13]  on the way to a job
[01:12:14 -> 01:12:14]  huh
[01:12:15 -> 01:12:20]  But I guess it's got to work.
[01:12:20 -> 01:12:22]  And hold on.
[01:12:22 -> 01:12:24]  Hey, buddy, don't do that.
[01:12:24 -> 01:12:32]  And she looks at Nyx, Ysidor, and Alara.
[01:12:32 -> 01:12:38]  She casts hold person, fourth level.
[01:12:38 -> 01:12:41]  No.
[01:12:41 -> 01:12:49]  So this is a wisdom saving throw for Nyx, Alara, and Ysidor.
[01:12:49 -> 01:13:03]  Wisdom saving throw.
[01:13:03 -> 01:13:04]  You all save.
[01:13:04 -> 01:13:05]  14 was the save.
[01:13:11 -> 01:13:11]  Yeah, so wait.
[01:13:11 -> 01:13:18]  Going back to the battle, like, well, that didn't work.
[01:13:18 -> 01:13:20]  That's their action.
[01:13:20 -> 01:13:24]  They don't have any other action there.
[01:13:24 -> 01:13:31]  So Nyx, it's your turn.
[01:13:31 -> 01:14:00]  I know.
[01:14:00 -> 01:14:03]  Yeah.
[01:14:03 -> 01:14:22]  Well, you have to attack first.
[01:14:22 -> 01:14:25]  And then you can use your Dreadful Strike.
[01:14:25 -> 01:14:35]  13 does not hit.
[01:14:35 -> 01:14:41]  No.
[01:14:41 -> 01:14:44]  Bonus action and movement.
[01:14:44 -> 01:14:49]  You could run into the woods.
[01:14:49 -> 01:14:51]  I will say the map is fairly accurate.
[01:14:51 -> 01:14:55]  You could get partial cover in the woods.
[01:14:55 -> 01:14:56]  Move your character.
[01:14:56 -> 01:14:59]  You guys can move your own tokens.
[01:14:59 -> 01:15:03]  Oh, Matt, for your reference, the square is five feet.
[01:15:03 -> 01:15:05]  And you can move your own tokens.
[01:15:05 -> 01:15:06]  Okay.
[01:15:06 -> 01:15:09]  And so to move one square, you move five feet.
[01:15:09 -> 01:15:11]  How far you can move is in your character sheet.
[01:15:11 -> 01:15:13]  So you're 30 feet.
[01:15:13 -> 01:15:18]  Yeah.
[01:15:18 -> 01:15:20]  Okay.
[01:15:20 -> 01:15:21]  Cool.
[01:15:21 -> 01:15:22]  Next turn.
[01:15:22 -> 01:15:23]  Baradun, your turn.
[01:15:23 -> 01:15:30]  Yeah.
[01:15:30 -> 01:15:32]  Only person.
[01:15:32 -> 01:15:39]  Yeah.
[01:15:39 -> 01:15:49]  Mm-hmm.
[01:15:49 -> 01:15:51]  What kind of, what do I have to roll?
[01:15:51 -> 01:16:03]  Wait.
[01:16:03 -> 01:16:04]  There's a save.
[01:16:04 -> 01:16:06]  There should be a save for that.
[01:16:06 -> 01:16:26]  There's not a save?
[01:16:26 -> 01:16:27]  Brock.
[01:16:27 -> 01:16:50]  No.
[01:16:50 -> 01:16:56]  So it's one ability.
[01:16:56 -> 01:17:00]  So that means you pick one ability.
[01:17:00 -> 01:17:03]  Hold on.
[01:17:03 -> 01:17:04]  I need to.
[01:17:04 -> 01:17:15]  I think ability is the stat block.
[01:17:15 -> 01:17:17]  Ability has to, yeah.
[01:17:17 -> 01:17:19]  So this is like strength saves and all that.
[01:17:19 -> 01:17:20]  Yeah.
[01:17:20 -> 01:17:22]  So you pick one of the main stats.
[01:17:22 -> 01:17:24]  No.
[01:17:24 -> 01:17:26]  So skill is when you do deception.
[01:17:26 -> 01:17:29]  Ability is technically like when,
[01:17:29 -> 01:17:32]  when you do like, for example,
[01:17:32 -> 01:17:41]  it refers to your scores.
[01:17:41 -> 01:17:45]  Or.
[01:17:45 -> 01:17:46]  Yeah.
[01:17:46 -> 01:17:47]  It's one of those.
[01:17:47 -> 01:17:48]  Yeah.
[01:17:48 -> 01:17:49]  So you have to pick one of the stats
[01:17:49 -> 01:18:02]  to have a disadvantage in.
[01:18:02 -> 01:18:04]  Well, it's just, yeah.
[01:18:04 -> 01:18:06]  But even normal hex like that.
[01:18:06 -> 01:18:07]  Yeah.
[01:18:07 -> 01:18:08]  But it's concentration.
[01:18:08 -> 01:18:10]  So I can break concentration.
[01:18:10 -> 01:18:15]  Yeah.
[01:18:15 -> 01:18:23]  Yeah.
[01:18:23 -> 01:18:28]  Okay.
[01:18:28 -> 01:18:42]  You have to move into range, but.
[01:18:47 -> 01:18:48]  Yeah.
[01:18:48 -> 01:19:07]  Imagine.
[01:19:07 -> 01:19:11]  Mm-hmm.
[01:19:11 -> 01:19:22]  Mm-hmm.
[01:19:22 -> 01:19:29]  Yeah.
[01:19:29 -> 01:19:42]  Mm-hmm.
[01:19:42 -> 01:19:44]  So you can add the damage.
[01:19:44 -> 01:19:46]  Because normally you couldn't add.
[01:19:46 -> 01:20:14]  Yeah.
[01:20:14 -> 01:20:30]  Where is, I don't see your mastery though.
[01:20:30 -> 01:20:31]  Red star.
[01:20:31 -> 01:20:32]  Yeah.
[01:20:32 -> 01:20:34]  Oh, Nick on your, oh, okay.
[01:20:34 -> 01:20:35]  Yeah.
[01:20:35 -> 01:20:36]  There.
[01:20:36 -> 01:20:40]  Yeah.
[01:20:40 -> 01:20:41]  Yeah.
[01:20:41 -> 01:20:47]  No, it's fine.
[01:20:47 -> 01:20:59]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:20:59 -> 01:21:13]  It's only like property.
[01:21:13 -> 01:21:16]  You can make it as part of the attack instead of bonus.
[01:21:16 -> 01:21:21]  Only once per turn.
[01:21:21 -> 01:21:31]  Okay.
[01:21:31 -> 01:21:41]  Well, it's like when melee characters get that,
[01:21:41 -> 01:21:43]  at level five or whatever.
[01:21:43 -> 01:21:46]  Oh, okay, okay, okay.
[01:21:46 -> 01:21:49]  So yeah, you can, that means with Nick,
[01:21:49 -> 01:22:12]  do two attack rolls.
[01:22:12 -> 01:22:13]  Yeah, cool, cool.
[01:22:13 -> 01:22:19]  Yeah, so roll to attack.
[01:22:19 -> 01:22:33]  That's fine.
[01:22:33 -> 01:22:35]  Yeah.
[01:22:35 -> 01:22:36]  Yeah.
[01:22:36 -> 01:22:40]  And I mean, you're just consuming your bardic
[01:22:40 -> 01:22:41]  inspiration for that.
[01:22:41 -> 01:22:46]  So just make sure you keep track of them,
[01:22:46 -> 01:22:48]  because you only have three.
[01:22:48 -> 01:22:55]  Yeah.
[01:22:55 -> 01:22:59]  Oh, OK.
[01:22:59 -> 01:23:12]  14 does not hit.
[01:23:12 -> 01:23:15]  Hold on.
[01:23:15 -> 01:23:17]  Yeah, usually Flourish has to hit.
[01:23:22 -> 01:23:26]  Hm.
[01:23:26 -> 01:23:29]  Yeah.
[01:23:29 -> 01:23:31]  Yeah, does not hit.
[01:23:31 -> 01:23:34]  Cool, cool, cool.
[01:23:34 -> 01:23:37]  Cool, so Alara's turn?
[01:23:37 -> 01:23:41]  Alara.
[01:23:41 -> 01:23:45]  Yeah.
[01:23:45 -> 01:23:50]  For any range?
[01:23:50 -> 01:23:52]  Well, not really, if you do touch.
[01:23:52 -> 01:23:54]  Some spells are touch.
[01:23:54 -> 01:23:58]  If it's a pew, pew, pew spell, yeah.
[01:23:58 -> 01:24:00]  It depends on if it's a range.
[01:24:00 -> 01:24:02]  Because some spells are like a touch spell,
[01:24:02 -> 01:24:04]  like Chilling Touch or Chilling Grasp or whatever.
[01:24:04 -> 01:24:05]  It's touch, right?
[01:24:05 -> 01:24:14]  So you have to be in melee range.
[01:24:14 -> 01:24:23]  It really depends on what spell you're using.
[01:24:23 -> 01:24:27]  Oh.
[01:24:27 -> 01:24:32]  Yeah.
[01:24:32 -> 01:24:37]  And obviously, like, something that stuff like Fireball
[01:24:37 -> 01:24:40]  or like Aerial Effects don't really apply,
[01:24:40 -> 01:24:43]  it's really single target range spells.
[01:24:43 -> 01:24:47]  So like if you're doing Scorching Ray.
[01:24:47 -> 01:25:07]  Yeah.
[01:25:07 -> 01:25:08]  What spell?
[01:25:08 -> 01:25:12]  It's usually Radius, I believe.
[01:25:12 -> 01:25:14]  Oh, Moonbeam, yeah, that's 5 feet.
[01:25:16 -> 01:25:19]  Yeah, Area is, well, it will say to Cylinder,
[01:25:19 -> 01:25:20]  drops down 5 foot radius.
[01:25:20 -> 01:25:22]  Yeah, it's a 5 foot radius.
[01:25:22 -> 01:25:32]  The description says the radius.
[01:25:32 -> 01:25:37]  And what is the save for Moonbeam?
[01:25:37 -> 01:25:42]  Con save, cool, cool, cool, cool.
[01:25:42 -> 01:25:44]  Hey, OK.
[01:25:44 -> 01:25:52]  Con save, saving throw, Constitution, just roll.
[01:25:52 -> 01:25:53]  I got an 8.
[01:25:53 -> 01:25:59]  I probably take full damage.
[01:25:59 -> 01:26:00]  How much damage?
[01:26:02 -> 01:26:04]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:26:04 -> 01:26:07]  You roll your damage.
[01:26:07 -> 01:26:08]  I'm not going to roll it.
[01:26:08 -> 01:26:10]  Can't accuse me of anything.
[01:26:10 -> 01:26:16]  9.
[01:26:16 -> 01:26:20]  Oh, yeah, no, all of that was gone.
[01:26:20 -> 01:26:29]  They drop that in a ..
[01:26:29 -> 01:26:48]  So you have bonus action and movement.
[01:26:48 -> 01:26:53]  Will you move?
[01:26:53 -> 01:26:59]  Oh, you don't want an opportunity attack from me?
[01:26:59 -> 01:27:02]  Witty, it's your turn.
[01:27:02 -> 01:27:05]  Feel free to ask all the questions you want.
[01:27:05 -> 01:27:06]  I realize it's the first time.
[01:27:44 -> 01:27:55]  This is based off of.
[01:27:55 -> 01:28:00]  Oh, oh, yeah, OK, thank you for the clarity.
[01:28:00 -> 01:28:03]  Yes, sorry, I thought it was like an art,
[01:28:03 -> 01:28:04]  because you're an artifice or two.
[01:28:04 -> 01:28:08]  I was like, wait, is this like magical items?
[01:28:08 -> 01:28:10]  Because, like, that's.
[01:28:10 -> 01:28:15]  Oh, yeah, the 2025, 2024 artificers
[01:28:15 -> 01:28:17]  can make common magical items.
[01:28:17 -> 01:28:22]  Anyways, point being, yeah, you can use it.
[01:28:22 -> 01:28:23]  Same rules apply.
[01:28:23 -> 01:28:29]  10-foot squared centered on a point within range.
[01:28:29 -> 01:29:11]  Yeah, OK, so you will have to roll an attack roll.
[01:29:11 -> 01:29:19]  If you click on the plus 5, yeah, so in your character sheet,
[01:29:19 -> 01:29:20]  you see.
[01:29:20 -> 01:29:20]  Yeah.
[01:29:20 -> 01:29:21]  Ray of sickness.
[01:29:21 -> 01:29:23]  You can do cast to use it.
[01:29:23 -> 01:29:24]  You see the plus 5.
[01:29:24 -> 01:29:30]  If you click on the plus 5, it'll auto-roll the attack for you.
[01:29:30 -> 01:29:32]  13 misses.
[01:29:32 -> 01:29:34]  You'll still consume the spell slot,
[01:29:34 -> 01:29:37]  so you have to check off the spell slot on the top.
[01:29:37 -> 01:29:38]  It misses.
[01:29:38 -> 01:29:49]  Yes, you can move, and you're outside of 5 feet,
[01:29:49 -> 01:29:51]  so you don't do opportunity attack,
[01:29:51 -> 01:29:57]  and you still have a bonus action.
[01:29:57 -> 01:30:19]  Yeah, probably not.
[01:30:19 -> 01:30:22]  Yeah, so you can move 30 feet.
[01:30:22 -> 01:30:24]  You can also use a ruler if you want
[01:30:24 -> 01:30:27]  to double-check the distance.
[01:30:27 -> 01:30:29]  So on the side, there's a rule.
[01:30:29 -> 01:30:31]  Yeah, click on this middle yourself,
[01:30:31 -> 01:30:33]  and I'll give you a little line.
[01:30:33 -> 01:30:48]  Whee!
[01:30:48 -> 01:30:50]  Awesome.
[01:30:50 -> 01:30:52]  Isidore, your turn.
[01:30:52 -> 01:31:06]  I don't have any.
[01:31:06 -> 01:31:12]  Doesn't it consume an action?
[01:31:12 -> 01:31:34]  Let me double.
[01:31:34 -> 01:31:35]  Yeah, that's fair.
[01:31:35 -> 01:31:36]  I do it all the time.
[01:31:36 -> 01:31:38]  You take the oath of the game the following to loving embrace.
[01:31:38 -> 01:31:39]  You take the oath of the game the following to loving embrace.
[01:31:39 -> 01:31:40]  You take the oath of the game the following to loving embrace.
[01:31:40 -> 01:31:41]  You take the oath of the game the following to loving embrace.
[01:31:41 -> 01:31:45]  You take the oath of the game the following to loving embrace.
[01:31:45 -> 01:31:46]  You take the oath of the game the following to loving embrace.
[01:31:46 -> 01:31:55]  Channel , action?
[01:31:55 -> 01:31:59]  Oh, it's the abilities themselves.
[01:31:59 -> 01:32:02]  It depends on what the ability is.
[01:32:02 -> 01:32:04]  Yeah, so loving embraces as an action,
[01:32:04 -> 01:32:08]  and then galvanize affection is an action.
[01:32:08 -> 01:32:10]  So it's what, in their description.
[01:32:10 -> 01:32:14]  And it consumes the, yeah.
[01:32:14 -> 01:32:30]  Now they're both actions.
[01:32:30 -> 01:32:31]  Yeah.
[01:32:31 -> 01:33:09]  yeah 24 does hit um one if it's a thrown weapon um so if you throw uh where sorry i
[01:33:09 -> 01:33:19]  know but for damage he has two different damage rolls um the second damage roll uh
[01:33:19 -> 01:33:30]  wait wait hold on thrown versus oh it's because it's versatile once two-handed versus one-handed
[01:33:30 -> 01:33:44]  so if it's two-handed you don't have a shield right yeah so one-handed so you do slightly
[01:33:44 -> 01:33:51]  less damage that's the difference you're doing a trident or your war pick yeah so it's 1d10
[01:33:51 -> 01:34:05]  two-handed 1d8 uh one-handed okay so roll your damage
[01:34:05 -> 01:34:40]  oh damn just one attack roll what's the duration okay so just one of the attack rolls cool
[01:34:41 -> 01:34:53]  bandit's turn a little tougher than you thought than i thought um oh this is interesting uh
[01:34:53 -> 01:35:05]  you gotta look to lara uh no it's like uh the hair is kind of the same so she didn't
[01:35:05 -> 01:35:11]  do like it was very like in the sense of like she didn't completely change what she looked
[01:35:11 -> 01:35:16]  like right like she just made herself look like a common i'm a young woman
[01:35:16 -> 01:35:23]  now she's kind of her her clothing a bit more skin tight you can see weapons um the face is
[01:35:23 -> 01:35:42]  pretty much the same i don't know that that's your question okay so the first attack roll
[01:35:42 -> 01:35:52]  will be with disadvantage um a 12 does a 12 hit a lara um i have three attacks uh so it's just
[01:35:52 -> 01:36:09]  attack roll right i have three attack rolls okay well this is gonna roll flat
[01:36:09 -> 01:36:27]  does a nine hit no does a 16 hit uh seven points of damage plus uh wait oh um 24 points of damage
[01:36:27 -> 01:36:37]  seven points of piercing uh 17 points of poison damage um concentrations broke so moonbeam's gone
[01:36:37 -> 01:36:54]  gotta love that moonbeam's good uh it hurts um she goes ah yeah take out the scrawny one first
[01:36:54 -> 01:36:59]  before i deal with tin can over there um cool
[01:36:59 -> 01:37:11]  cool um she's not gonna move because well um yeah because attacks of opportunity
[01:37:11 -> 01:37:16]  um let me double check she doesn't have bonus actions at all
[01:37:16 -> 01:37:26]  um
[01:37:26 -> 01:37:29]  Okay.
[01:37:35 -> 01:37:36]  She wanted to get rid of that.
[01:37:36 -> 01:37:38]  Okay, end of her turn. She's not moving.
[01:37:39 -> 01:37:40]  Nyx, your turn.
[01:37:43 -> 01:37:44]  No, you haven't been. Don't lie to me.
[01:38:00 -> 01:38:00]  Yeah.
[01:38:01 -> 01:38:02]  I trust you.
[01:38:11 -> 01:38:13]  A 25 does hit.
[01:38:31 -> 01:38:32]  Your character should.
[01:38:48 -> 01:38:49]  Yeah, it's okay.
[01:38:56 -> 01:38:57]  Loving it.
[01:39:02 -> 01:39:03]  You rolled a...
[01:39:03 -> 01:39:05]  Oh yeah, you rolled horribly.
[01:39:05 -> 01:39:07]  So that's 11 points of damage.
[01:39:11 -> 01:39:14]  Anything else?
[01:39:30 -> 01:39:30]  Yeah.
[01:39:31 -> 01:39:35]  It works because the end of his turn...
[01:39:35 -> 01:39:36]  So he...
[01:39:36 -> 01:39:39]  At the beginning of his next turn, he can do an attack, right?
[01:39:40 -> 01:39:41]  So it will be
[01:39:41 -> 01:39:42]  still in effect
[01:39:42 -> 01:39:44]  when his turn comes up next.
[01:39:45 -> 01:39:47]  It's after his turn.
[01:39:52 -> 01:39:53]  You can, but
[01:39:53 -> 01:39:55]  you wouldn't add your bonus
[01:39:55 -> 01:39:57]  to the damage on the second one
[01:39:57 -> 01:39:58]  if they're both light.
[01:39:58 -> 01:39:59]  Unless you have, like,
[01:39:59 -> 01:40:01]  Mastery and all that, right?
[01:40:01 -> 01:40:06]  That's kind of like...
[01:40:06 -> 01:40:06]  Yeah.
[01:40:18 -> 01:40:19]  Yeah.
[01:40:19 -> 01:40:19]  Yeah.
[01:40:21 -> 01:40:21]  Yeah.
[01:40:30 -> 01:40:31]  Undersmark.
[01:40:31 -> 01:40:32]  Okay, and what's...
[01:40:32 -> 01:40:34]  I have to look that up again.
[01:40:51 -> 01:40:51]  Yeah, there's, like,
[01:40:51 -> 01:40:52]  yeah, wisdom stuff.
[01:40:54 -> 01:40:55]  Yeah, you'll have.
[01:40:59 -> 01:41:01]  I mean, technically,
[01:41:01 -> 01:41:02]  you did it in the wrong order,
[01:41:02 -> 01:41:03]  but I'm not going to be an asshole.
[01:41:08 -> 01:41:09]  Rules as written.
[01:41:11 -> 01:41:12]  Yeah, okay.
[01:41:13 -> 01:41:14]  I'll put green.
[01:41:15 -> 01:41:15]  Yeah.
[01:41:15 -> 01:41:15]  Yeah.
[01:41:16 -> 01:41:17]  Yeah.
[01:41:17 -> 01:41:18]  Um, any, uh, movement.
[01:41:21 -> 01:41:21]  Yep.
[01:41:22 -> 01:41:23]  Uh,
[01:41:23 -> 01:41:24]  do-do-do-do-do.
[01:41:24 -> 01:41:26]  And, Matt, just for your reference,
[01:41:26 -> 01:41:27]  yeah, combat gets long.
[01:41:27 -> 01:41:29]  I help facilitate it,
[01:41:29 -> 01:41:29]  so I'll be like,
[01:41:29 -> 01:41:31]  your action, your bonus action.
[01:41:31 -> 01:41:32]  Uh, if I'm smart,
[01:41:32 -> 01:41:34]  I tell you when your turn's
[01:41:34 -> 01:41:35]  going to be next.
[01:41:35 -> 01:41:35]  So Baradun's,
[01:41:36 -> 01:41:37]  Din's next with
[01:41:37 -> 01:41:38]  Alar doing a death save after.
[01:41:39 -> 01:41:40]  Uh, Din.
[01:41:40 -> 01:41:48]  Well, it's because you're casting,
[01:41:48 -> 01:41:49]  you're casting less spells,
[01:41:50 -> 01:41:50]  mostly.
[01:41:53 -> 01:41:53]  Yeah.
[01:42:07 -> 01:42:08]  And then Mark's like,
[01:42:08 -> 01:42:09]  I shoot,
[01:42:09 -> 01:42:12]  but when Mark went
[01:42:12 -> 01:42:14]  on top of the turn,
[01:42:14 -> 01:42:15]  he had assassinate.
[01:42:15 -> 01:42:16]  Fucking wrecked.
[01:42:17 -> 01:42:17]  When Mark hit,
[01:42:17 -> 01:42:18]  he wrecked shit.
[01:42:18 -> 01:42:19]  It's just,
[01:42:19 -> 01:42:20]  when he didn't,
[01:42:20 -> 01:42:20]  he was like,
[01:42:20 -> 01:42:22]  I'm going to roll my attack.
[01:42:36 -> 01:42:37]  So, uh,
[01:42:37 -> 01:42:38]  Matt, for context,
[01:42:38 -> 01:42:40]  when you roll a nat 20
[01:42:40 -> 01:42:40]  on an attack,
[01:42:41 -> 01:42:42]  hit all your dice rolls
[01:42:42 -> 01:42:43]  for damage
[01:42:43 -> 01:42:44]  or you rolled twice
[01:42:44 -> 01:42:45]  the amount of dice.
[01:42:46 -> 01:42:47]  The modifiers are the same,
[01:42:47 -> 01:42:48]  so if it's plus three,
[01:42:48 -> 01:42:48]  it's still plus three.
[01:42:48 -> 01:42:49]  But if it's 2d6,
[01:42:50 -> 01:42:50]  that becomes,
[01:42:50 -> 01:42:51]  that's 4d6.
[01:42:52 -> 01:42:54]  And because he had,
[01:42:54 -> 01:42:54]  um,
[01:42:55 -> 01:42:56]  what it was called,
[01:42:56 -> 01:42:56]  uh,
[01:42:57 -> 01:42:58]  stealth attack,
[01:42:58 -> 01:43:00]  that's like 4d6 on its own
[01:43:00 -> 01:43:01]  on top of everything.
[01:43:01 -> 01:43:01]  So, yeah,
[01:43:01 -> 01:43:02]  it was ridiculous.
[01:43:02 -> 01:43:03]  Um,
[01:43:03 -> 01:43:03]  but Din,
[01:43:03 -> 01:43:04]  it's your turn.
[01:43:13 -> 01:43:14]  Okay.
[01:43:14 -> 01:43:15]  Roll the heal.
[01:43:27 -> 01:43:29]  Roll your heal.
[01:43:29 -> 01:43:42]  So,
[01:43:42 -> 01:43:43]  13,
[01:43:43 -> 01:43:44]  you got 13 HP,
[01:43:45 -> 01:43:45]  Alara.
[01:43:45 -> 01:43:46]  You're up on your feet.
[01:43:47 -> 01:43:47]  Um,
[01:43:47 -> 01:43:49]  action and movement for Din.
[01:43:54 -> 01:43:55]  Sure.
[01:43:55 -> 01:43:55]  Sure.
[01:43:57 -> 01:43:57]  Yeah.
[01:43:59 -> 01:43:59]  Yeah.
[01:44:04 -> 01:44:09]  Yeah.
[01:44:10 -> 01:44:11]  Roll to attack.
[01:44:12 -> 01:44:13]  Roll to attack.
[01:44:15 -> 01:44:17]  14 does not hit.
[01:44:19 -> 01:44:20]  16 meets it,
[01:44:20 -> 01:44:20]  beats it.
[01:44:21 -> 01:44:21]  16 hits.
[01:44:22 -> 01:44:27]  Oh, yeah.
[01:44:28 -> 01:44:28]  It's not a cast.
[01:44:28 -> 01:44:29]  You got me for a second.
[01:44:29 -> 01:44:29]  I was like,
[01:44:30 -> 01:44:30]  what the fuck
[01:44:30 -> 01:44:31]  are you talking about, boy?
[01:44:32 -> 01:44:32]  Um,
[01:44:39 -> 01:44:39]  oh,
[01:44:39 -> 01:44:40]  defensive flourish.
[01:44:45 -> 01:44:46]  Uh,
[01:44:47 -> 01:44:48]  I don't care.
[01:44:49 -> 01:44:49]  Um,
[01:44:49 -> 01:44:50]  five.
[01:44:54 -> 01:44:54]  Mm-hmm.
[01:44:56 -> 01:44:56]  Seven.
[01:44:58 -> 01:44:59]  Yeah.
[01:45:00 -> 01:45:01]  Yep.
[01:45:02 -> 01:45:02]  Nice.
[01:45:03 -> 01:45:03]  Uh,
[01:45:03 -> 01:45:03]  movement.
[01:45:07 -> 01:45:07]  Yeah.
[01:45:07 -> 01:45:07]  Okay.
[01:45:08 -> 01:45:08]  Cool, cool, cool.
[01:45:08 -> 01:45:09]  Alara,
[01:45:09 -> 01:45:10]  you just heard,
[01:45:11 -> 01:45:12]  you heard kind of
[01:45:12 -> 01:45:13]  as your unconscious
[01:45:13 -> 01:45:14]  Din saying,
[01:45:14 -> 01:45:15]  just trust me,
[01:45:15 -> 01:45:16]  and you come back up
[01:45:16 -> 01:45:17]  with 13,
[01:45:18 -> 01:45:19]  13 HP.
[01:45:20 -> 01:45:21]  I don't know where
[01:45:21 -> 01:45:21]  you got 24.
[01:45:21 -> 01:45:22]  I don't know where you got 24.
[01:45:22 -> 01:45:37]  I see 24 on mine.
[01:45:42 -> 01:45:43]  Okay.
[01:45:43 -> 01:45:44]  I'll trust you.
[01:45:53 -> 01:45:53]  Okay.
[01:45:55 -> 01:45:56]  Okay.
[01:46:11 -> 01:46:11]  Oh,
[01:46:11 -> 01:46:13]  it still shows 24 for me.
[01:46:13 -> 01:46:13]  Weird.
[01:46:26 -> 01:46:27]  Oh, yeah.
[01:46:27 -> 01:46:28]  What's that?
[01:46:34 -> 01:46:34]  Okay.
[01:46:51 -> 01:46:51]  Well,
[01:46:51 -> 01:46:52]  you could use an action
[01:46:52 -> 01:46:53]  to take
[01:46:53 -> 01:46:55]  and move,
[01:46:55 -> 01:46:56]  and then you have
[01:46:56 -> 01:46:57]  your bonus action.
[01:47:29 -> 01:47:30]  Well, yeah,
[01:47:30 -> 01:47:30]  if it's slotted,
[01:47:30 -> 01:47:31]  right?
[01:47:31 -> 01:47:31]  Yeah.
[01:47:31 -> 01:47:32]  You could only do it
[01:47:32 -> 01:47:33]  if you can trip.
[01:47:33 -> 01:47:44]  Hmm.
[01:47:44 -> 01:47:50]  Wait,
[01:47:50 -> 01:47:51]  feature.
[01:47:51 -> 01:47:56]  Wait,
[01:47:56 -> 01:47:57]  wait,
[01:47:57 -> 01:47:58]  wait,
[01:47:58 -> 01:47:59]  features.
[01:47:59 -> 01:48:00]  It's class features,
[01:48:00 -> 01:48:01]  right?
[01:48:06 -> 01:48:07]  Yeah.
[01:48:07 -> 01:48:08]  But it's still a first level.
[01:48:08 -> 01:48:09]  It's a first level spell.
[01:48:09 -> 01:48:10]  Yeah.
[01:48:10 -> 01:48:11]  It's easier just to describe it as spell slots.
[01:48:11 -> 01:48:14]  But,
[01:48:14 -> 01:48:15]  okay.
[01:48:15 -> 01:48:16]  Use your action to disengage.
[01:48:16 -> 01:48:17]  You can do your movement and whatever bonus action you want.
[01:48:17 -> 01:48:18]  Y'all up there.
[01:48:18 -> 01:48:19]  Hey,
[01:48:19 -> 01:48:23]  I'm up there.
[01:48:23 -> 01:48:24]  Hey,
[01:48:24 -> 01:48:25]  I'm up there.
[01:48:25 -> 01:48:26]  Hey,
[01:48:26 -> 01:48:27]  I'm up there.
[01:48:27 -> 01:48:28]  Hey,
[01:48:28 -> 01:48:35]  I'm up there.
[01:48:35 -> 01:48:36]  Hey,
[01:48:36 -> 01:48:43]  I'm up there.
[01:48:43 -> 01:48:44]  Hey,
[01:48:44 -> 01:49:18]  sweetheart.
[01:49:18 -> 01:49:19]  Yeah,
[01:49:19 -> 01:49:22]  put it on the,
[01:49:22 -> 01:49:23]  yeah,
[01:49:23 -> 01:49:41]  it should be the size of a tile.
[01:49:41 -> 01:49:42]  Nice.
[01:49:42 -> 01:49:43]  So,
[01:49:43 -> 01:49:44]  you're up to 16.
[01:49:44 -> 01:49:45]  Witty,
[01:49:45 -> 01:49:46]  it is your turn.
[01:49:46 -> 01:49:49]  Yeah.
[01:49:49 -> 01:49:50]  So,
[01:49:50 -> 01:49:51]  no,
[01:49:51 -> 01:49:52]  I was just saying,
[01:49:52 -> 01:49:53]  it's your turn.
[01:49:53 -> 01:49:54]  Okay.
[01:49:54 -> 01:49:55]  60 feet.
[01:49:55 -> 01:50:15]  Yeah,
[01:50:15 -> 01:50:16]  you'll have to,
[01:50:16 -> 01:50:17]  you,
[01:50:17 -> 01:50:18]  there is a little shape overlays.
[01:50:18 -> 01:50:19]  It's,
[01:50:19 -> 01:50:20]  oh,
[01:50:20 -> 01:50:21]  and then,
[01:50:21 -> 01:50:22]  oh,
[01:50:22 -> 01:50:23]  oh,
[01:50:23 -> 01:50:24]  oh,
[01:50:24 -> 01:50:25]  oh,
[01:50:25 -> 01:50:26]  and then,
[01:50:26 -> 01:50:27]  what,
[01:50:27 -> 01:50:28]  what is the shape?
[01:50:28 -> 01:50:29]  It tells you the shape.
[01:50:29 -> 01:50:30]  It's 10 foot,
[01:50:30 -> 01:50:31]  10 foot square.
[01:50:31 -> 01:50:37]  So,
[01:50:37 -> 01:50:38]  yeah.
[01:50:38 -> 01:50:39]  So,
[01:50:39 -> 01:50:40]  this would be 10 feet.
[01:50:40 -> 01:50:41]  I can move it for you.
[01:50:41 -> 01:50:42]  All right,
[01:50:42 -> 01:50:43]  you move it.
[01:50:43 -> 01:50:44]  Nice.
[01:50:44 -> 01:50:45]  Yeah.
[01:50:45 -> 01:50:46]  So,
[01:50:46 -> 01:50:47]  basically,
[01:50:47 -> 01:50:50]  yeah,
[01:50:50 -> 01:50:53]  you want to,
[01:50:53 -> 01:50:54]  like,
[01:50:54 -> 01:51:08]  throw it on.
[01:51:08 -> 01:51:09]  Oh,
[01:51:09 -> 01:51:10]  yeah,
[01:51:10 -> 01:51:11]  yeah.
[01:51:11 -> 01:51:12]  So,
[01:51:12 -> 01:51:13]  it's difficult terrain.
[01:51:13 -> 01:51:14]  And you did it just so they are,
[01:51:14 -> 01:51:15]  they're like that,
[01:51:15 -> 01:51:16]  right?
[01:51:16 -> 01:51:17]  Yeah.
[01:51:17 -> 01:51:18]  Cool.
[01:51:18 -> 01:51:19]  They got a dirty 20.
[01:51:19 -> 01:51:20]  They're on their feet.
[01:51:20 -> 01:51:21]  Not full health yet.
[01:51:21 -> 01:51:25]  No,
[01:51:25 -> 01:51:31]  because it's a spell slot.
[01:51:31 -> 01:51:32]  Grease is a spell slot.
[01:51:32 -> 01:51:39]  And healing words is a spell slot.
[01:51:39 -> 01:51:40]  Can't.
[01:51:40 -> 01:51:41]  So,
[01:51:41 -> 01:51:42]  you could only do,
[01:51:42 -> 01:51:43]  well,
[01:51:43 -> 01:51:44]  they're all actions.
[01:51:44 -> 01:51:45]  Only a cantrip after,
[01:51:45 -> 01:51:46]  if,
[01:51:46 -> 01:51:47]  only a cantrip level after that.
[01:51:47 -> 01:51:48]  Or a level zero is also a cantrip.
[01:51:48 -> 01:51:49]  Yeah.
[01:51:49 -> 01:51:50]  No,
[01:51:50 -> 01:51:51]  no worries.
[01:51:51 -> 01:51:52]  Yes,
[01:51:52 -> 01:51:53]  yes,
[01:51:53 -> 01:51:54]  yes,
[01:51:54 -> 01:51:55]  yes,
[01:51:55 -> 01:51:56]  yes,
[01:51:56 -> 01:52:04]  yes,
[01:52:04 -> 01:52:05]  yes,
[01:52:05 -> 01:52:06]  yes,
[01:52:06 -> 01:52:07]  yes,
[01:52:07 -> 01:52:08]  yes,
[01:52:08 -> 01:52:11]  yes,
[01:52:11 -> 01:52:18]  you don't trust any of these.
[01:52:18 -> 01:52:19]  Isidor,
[01:52:19 -> 01:52:20]  your turn.
[01:52:20 -> 01:52:29]  Yeah.
[01:52:29 -> 01:52:30]  She's skedaddled.
[01:52:30 -> 01:52:53]  they look fairly healthy.
[01:52:53 -> 01:52:54]  Yes vice.
[01:52:54 -> 01:52:55]  Okay.
[01:52:55 -> 01:53:15]  Um,
[01:53:15 -> 01:53:16]  uh,
[01:53:16 -> 01:53:17]  divine pop arch,
[01:53:17 -> 01:53:18]  oh,
[01:53:18 -> 01:53:21]  okay,
[01:53:21 -> 01:53:22]  yeah,
[01:53:22 -> 01:53:43]  bonus action.
[01:53:43 -> 01:53:44]  22 hits.
[01:53:44 -> 01:53:50]  Yeah,
[01:53:50 -> 01:53:51]  you got your dom,
[01:53:51 -> 01:53:52]  it's 11.
[01:53:52 -> 01:53:53]  No,
[01:53:53 -> 01:53:54]  I don't see a divine favorite.
[01:53:54 -> 01:54:03]  What does?
[01:54:03 -> 01:54:04]  I didn't pal.
[01:54:04 -> 01:54:05]  Yeah.
[01:54:05 -> 01:54:06]  I've been doing it for her thing.
[01:54:06 -> 01:54:07]  So,
[01:54:07 -> 01:54:09]  Don't worry.
[01:54:09 -> 01:54:13]  Yeah, do you want to move?
[01:54:13 -> 01:54:17]  OK, so they look at all of you.
[01:54:17 -> 01:54:24]  They're kind of, hmm, I guess we're going to, let's see,
[01:54:24 -> 01:54:33]  circle, wait, how big, 10 feet?
[01:54:33 -> 01:54:41]  Yeah, can they, let's, yeah, so Din's the only one not
[01:54:41 -> 01:54:45]  getting hit by this.
[01:54:45 -> 01:54:53]  Witty, Nyx, Isidore, Alara, all roll a constitution saving
[01:54:53 -> 01:55:02]  throw, DC 14.
[01:55:02 -> 01:55:03]  OK, 23.
[01:55:15 -> 01:55:19]  On Nyx and Alara, 11 points of damage.
[01:55:19 -> 01:55:23]  You're both blinded until the start of the next bandits turn.
[01:55:27 -> 01:55:30]  And for the rest of you, that's 5 points
[01:55:30 -> 01:55:31]  of damage.
[01:55:31 -> 01:55:34]  So Witty, 5 points of damage.
[01:55:34 -> 01:55:39]  Isidore, 5 points of damage.
[01:55:39 -> 01:55:41]  Blinded means you can't see.
[01:55:41 -> 01:55:44]  So anything that requires sight, you failed.
[01:55:44 -> 01:55:46]  Attacks against you have advantage.
[01:55:46 -> 01:55:53]  You have disadvantage on attacks.
[01:55:53 -> 01:55:56]  You can still attack, but just think
[01:55:56 -> 01:55:58]  attacking with a blindfold.
[01:56:03 -> 01:56:05]  No, no, you can still attack.
[01:56:05 -> 01:56:08]  You're just disadvantage.
[01:56:08 -> 01:56:08]  OK.
[01:56:11 -> 01:56:14]  Oh, you have advantage?
[01:56:14 -> 01:56:15]  I got rid of my circle.
[01:56:15 -> 01:56:23]  I was just seeing.
[01:56:23 -> 01:56:30]  No.
[01:56:30 -> 01:56:38]  Basically, she, basically, it doesn't even say what it,
[01:56:38 -> 01:56:39]  do you see it's using?
[01:56:39 -> 01:56:42]  I guess it's like, it's some kind of like spell thing.
[01:56:42 -> 01:56:43]  Anyway, it's kind of like a fireball,
[01:56:43 -> 01:56:45]  but it's blinding flash.
[01:56:45 -> 01:56:49]  It's basically, what you saw is they threw something up
[01:56:49 -> 01:56:49]  in the air.
[01:56:49 -> 01:56:50]  It exploded.
[01:56:50 -> 01:56:50]  It exploded.
[01:56:50 -> 01:56:54]  It's blinding two of you.
[01:56:54 -> 01:56:56]  Yeah.
[01:56:56 -> 01:57:01]  Yeah, so that's their turn.
[01:57:01 -> 01:57:03]  They're kind of stuck between Isidore and Din,
[01:57:03 -> 01:57:09]  so they're not going to move.
[01:57:09 -> 01:57:43]  Nyx, it's your turn.
[01:57:43 -> 01:57:43]  Yeah.
[01:57:46 -> 01:58:00]  Yeah, so you roll flat.
[01:58:00 -> 01:58:03]  Where did the second Nyx come from?
[01:58:04 -> 01:58:12]  Also, there's a Nyx.
[01:58:12 -> 01:58:14]  Nyx's twin Twix.
[01:58:31 -> 01:58:57]  A 26 hits.
[01:58:57 -> 01:58:59]  No, it automatically, you cast it.
[01:58:59 -> 01:59:07]  It's a con, wait, question.
[01:59:07 -> 01:59:10]  Yeah, once you cast it.
[01:59:10 -> 01:59:11]  Yeah, it stays.
[01:59:11 -> 01:59:23]  It stays.
[01:59:23 -> 01:59:26]  Yeah, it's a concentration.
[01:59:26 -> 01:59:28]  But you and Alara both took damage.
[01:59:28 -> 01:59:41]  damage alara is your con you both need a con save 10 uh wait uh wait fuck yeah it's or half damage
[01:59:41 -> 01:59:48]  yeah whatever uh yeah so it's 10 uh it's minimum of 10 so both roll a con save you both need to
[01:59:48 -> 02:00:04]  beat 10 to keep your concentration up yeah you you held on to your hunter's mark alara has dropped
[02:00:04 -> 02:00:33]  uh their healing thing yeah so you can roll the extra damage whatever it was isn't it when you
[02:00:33 -> 02:00:43]  attack yeah you have a good you only used one of them so you can use one more on your attack
[02:00:43 -> 02:01:48]  and add the damage no it's twice that's fine that's fine yeah okie dokie din it's your turn
[02:01:48 -> 02:02:00]  okay
[02:02:00 -> 02:02:21]  uh two hits
[02:02:21 -> 02:02:34]  mm-hmm
[02:02:34 -> 02:03:24]  mm-hmm
[02:03:24 -> 02:03:28]  all right seven damage for your next attack or ten in total
[02:03:28 -> 02:03:33]  big
[02:03:33 -> 02:03:35]  well
[02:03:35 -> 02:03:39]  okay yeah because i see another hex that's why i saw a second hex that's why
[02:03:44 -> 02:03:46]  that's fine
[02:03:46 -> 02:03:58]  okay and so you can inc so um your defensive flourish only lost in the beginning of your next turn so i guess you're renewing that so you have a higher ac
[02:03:58 -> 02:04:02]  okay and nice
[02:04:02 -> 02:04:58]  cool cool cool um any you movement that's fine no uh if you move out yeah as long as you don't leave the her reach which is five nice alara it is your turn uh uh wait no it's uh until the start of the bandits next turn yeah so you're still blind it they do nothing
[02:04:58 -> 02:05:00]  true sight
[02:05:00 -> 02:05:05]  you'd probably have like true sight or something
[02:05:05 -> 02:05:18]  yeah you're touching yourself
[02:05:18 -> 02:05:23]  mm-hmm
[02:05:23 -> 02:05:30]  yeah
[02:05:30 -> 02:05:32]  don't like that last time
[02:05:32 -> 02:05:34]  mm-hmm
[02:05:34 -> 02:05:36]  mm-hmm
[02:05:36 -> 02:05:44]  well they could still do an aoe
[02:05:44 -> 02:05:54]  uh
[02:05:54 -> 02:05:56]  you would have to do a hide action
[02:05:56 -> 02:06:10]  we're also seeing the tops of the trees the tops can be like fairly like
[02:06:10 -> 02:06:12]  um okay so
[02:06:12 -> 02:06:21]  witty it is your turn
[02:06:21 -> 02:06:28]  yeah yeah
[02:06:28 -> 02:06:30]  uh
[02:06:30 -> 02:06:32]  well
[02:06:32 -> 02:06:36]  you're level three eventually you'll have like a bunch of level one slots and then like you build up
[02:06:36 -> 02:06:59]  yeah it sucks but you can uh do pro spellcasters can do probably the most damn it sometimes like yeah i mean that's a whole warlock thing
[02:06:59 -> 02:07:01]  yeah
[02:07:01 -> 02:07:06]  yeah i don't care what order
[02:07:06 -> 02:07:07]  oh okay um so we're just gonna have to go through that so we're just gonna have to go through that
[02:07:07 -> 02:07:42]  Oh, OK.
[02:07:42 -> 02:07:44]  OK, you're going to aim the line.
[02:07:44 -> 02:07:45]  Ah, nice.
[02:07:53 -> 02:07:57]  No, there's a line overlay.
[02:07:57 -> 02:08:00]  It's 30 feet long, 5 feet wide.
[02:08:00 -> 02:08:03]  I think it automatically does 5 feet.
[02:08:03 -> 02:08:07]  So this is, yeah, you could, oh, you would be very close.
[02:08:07 -> 02:08:10]  So basically, right in front of Yesenor and Dan,
[02:08:10 -> 02:08:14]  you just see like acid.
[02:08:14 -> 02:08:31]  And a deck save.
[02:08:31 -> 02:08:33]  OK, they have to do a deck save.
[02:08:33 -> 02:08:35]  Cool, cool, cool, cool.
[02:08:35 -> 02:08:36]  Where is my battle map?
[02:08:36 -> 02:08:40]  Sorry, I really should put it on a separate thing.
[02:08:40 -> 02:08:44]  Deck save, they have, they get a 16.
[02:08:44 -> 02:08:48]  So I believe they save because your DC is a 13.
[02:08:48 -> 02:08:57]  Cool, they'll still probably take some damage.
[02:08:57 -> 02:08:59]  Oh, they take none.
[02:08:59 -> 02:09:00]  Oh, it's not one of those.
[02:09:00 -> 02:09:07]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:09:07 -> 02:09:12]  OK.
[02:09:12 -> 02:09:16]  No, Greece, they're still in Greece.
[02:09:16 -> 02:09:19]  They just haven't moved.
[02:09:19 -> 02:09:22]  Yeah.
[02:09:22 -> 02:09:25]  And by the way, movement, you have 30 feet in your turn.
[02:09:25 -> 02:09:28]  So you can like move, do an attack, move.
[02:09:28 -> 02:09:29]  Like, I don't care.
[02:09:29 -> 02:09:31]  Like, they would do that before, where it's like,
[02:09:31 -> 02:09:34]  I'm hiding behind a tree that gives me cover.
[02:09:34 -> 02:09:37]  They move out of the way, poom, move back in.
[02:09:37 -> 02:09:40]  That was a classic, classic spell.
[02:09:40 -> 02:09:44]  Spell caster, they're like, oh, I'm going to lean out the door.
[02:09:44 -> 02:09:46]  Cast, go back in.
[02:09:46 -> 02:09:48]  I have a wall.
[02:09:48 -> 02:09:54]  So you can be annoying about it.
[02:09:54 -> 02:09:54]  No, it's fine.
[02:09:54 -> 02:10:00]  Eh.
[02:10:00 -> 02:10:10]  I think I'm like 10 feet.
[02:10:10 -> 02:10:11]  Fair, fair, fair.
[02:10:11 -> 02:10:18]  Isidore, your turn.
[02:10:18 -> 02:10:23]  OK, go for it.
[02:10:23 -> 02:10:48]  19 hits.
[02:10:48 -> 02:10:50]  Oh, I just did it as we went.
[02:10:50 -> 02:10:50]  It's.
[02:10:50 -> 02:10:51]  It's.
[02:10:51 -> 02:10:51]  It's.
[02:10:51 -> 02:10:52]  It's.
[02:10:52 -> 02:10:55]  It was like 26 points of damage.
[02:10:55 -> 02:10:57]  But yeah.
[02:10:57 -> 02:10:59]  Yeah.
[02:10:59 -> 02:11:03]  What?
[02:11:03 -> 02:11:06]  Yeah, on the first one, right?
[02:11:06 -> 02:11:09]  Cool, it's her turn.
[02:11:09 -> 02:11:10]  She's getting a little annoyed, but she's
[02:11:10 -> 02:11:16]  going to go for the little guy.
[02:11:16 -> 02:11:27]  Disadvantage on the first one, right?
[02:11:27 -> 02:11:34]  Double crit.
[02:11:34 -> 02:11:36]  Unferited.
[02:11:36 -> 02:11:46]  Do you have a spell slot?
[02:11:46 -> 02:11:54]  That is wild.
[02:11:54 -> 02:11:55]  Yes, you can cast silver.
[02:11:55 -> 02:11:58]  You know some DMs ban silvery bar.
[02:11:58 -> 02:11:58]  Oops.
[02:11:58 -> 02:12:11]  I turned .
[02:12:11 -> 02:12:13]  Wait, no, it's fine.
[02:12:13 -> 02:12:14]  Oh, yeah.
[02:12:14 -> 02:12:16]  I'm fine with it.
[02:12:16 -> 02:12:17]  I just wanted to know what it did.
[02:12:17 -> 02:12:18]  I was going to take it away.
[02:12:18 -> 02:12:19]  I wouldn't.
[02:12:19 -> 02:12:21]  If I were to take it away, it wouldn't be now.
[02:12:21 -> 02:12:22]  It'd be later.
[02:12:22 -> 02:12:23]  But I'm not going to.
[02:12:23 -> 02:12:30]  I would never fuck you over in the moment.
[02:12:30 -> 02:12:32]  to see on the social change casting,
[02:12:32 -> 02:12:35]  which you take when a creature you see with.
[02:12:35 -> 02:12:36]  OK, yeah.
[02:12:36 -> 02:12:38]  You magically distract the character and turn over.
[02:12:41 -> 02:12:42]  Okay, so they would
[02:12:42 -> 02:12:45]  and use the lower roll. So they just roll
[02:12:45 -> 02:12:47]  one more d20. If they get another
[02:12:47 -> 02:12:48]  nat 20, that would be hilarious.
[02:12:50 -> 02:12:54]  This was a good chance.
[02:12:55 -> 02:12:55]  Okay.
[02:12:57 -> 02:12:58]  Okay, okay, okay.
[02:12:58 -> 02:13:00]  So let's go back to the map.
[02:13:00 -> 02:13:02]  Yeah, silvery barbs is
[02:13:02 -> 02:13:04]  legit. I need to
[02:13:04 -> 02:13:06]  I'm just going to roll the attack roll
[02:13:06 -> 02:13:08]  again, just like flat.
[02:13:11 -> 02:13:11]  13
[02:13:11 -> 02:13:14]  does not hit.
[02:13:15 -> 02:13:16]  Okay. Yeah, so
[02:13:16 -> 02:13:18]  you can wait.
[02:13:18 -> 02:13:20]  No, this is the first attack.
[02:13:20 -> 02:13:22]  She just had disadvantage on her first attack.
[02:13:22 -> 02:13:24]  I have two more hits.
[02:13:25 -> 02:13:26]  And you have no more
[02:13:26 -> 02:13:27]  reactions.
[02:13:29 -> 02:13:31]  Yeah, because it's only one reaction.
[02:13:32 -> 02:13:33]  Okay.
[02:13:34 -> 02:13:34]  So
[02:13:34 -> 02:13:37]  decide who you're going to give advantage
[02:13:37 -> 02:13:39]  to. You can give
[02:13:39 -> 02:13:40]  it to yourself, too. Yeah.
[02:13:41 -> 02:13:42]  Seven does not
[02:13:42 -> 02:13:43]  hit.
[02:13:43 -> 02:13:45]  And 12
[02:13:45 -> 02:13:46]  doesn't hit.
[02:13:46 -> 02:13:49]  I lost all my luck with that.
[02:13:49 -> 02:13:50]  That was a
[02:13:50 -> 02:13:53]  You realize I would
[02:13:53 -> 02:13:55]  have killed you like 10
[02:13:55 -> 02:13:55]  times over.
[02:13:56 -> 02:13:57]  I think.
[02:13:59 -> 02:14:00]  No,
[02:14:01 -> 02:14:03]  like, just the poison
[02:14:03 -> 02:14:04]  alone would have been
[02:14:04 -> 02:14:07]  6d6 of poison damage.
[02:14:13 -> 02:14:14]  Oh, yeah, like, let's
[02:14:14 -> 02:14:15]  see. It would have been
[02:14:16 -> 02:14:17]  30 points just
[02:14:17 -> 02:14:18]  on the poison.
[02:14:22 -> 02:14:24]  11 on that plus two more
[02:14:24 -> 02:14:26]  d4s. So, like, that would average
[02:14:26 -> 02:14:28]  out to four more points. So, it would
[02:14:28 -> 02:14:30]  have been, like, 45 points of damage
[02:14:30 -> 02:14:32]  ish in the ballpark.
[02:14:38 -> 02:14:41]  I think I shat myself.
[02:14:44 -> 02:14:46]  By the way, I forgot to
[02:14:46 -> 02:14:48]  roll one thing. I just need to roll
[02:14:48 -> 02:14:48]  a d6.
[02:14:51 -> 02:14:53]  Oh, okay. I don't get that back.
[02:14:53 -> 02:14:54]  Cool.
[02:14:56 -> 02:14:58]  D6. It is your turn.
[02:14:59 -> 02:15:01]  You're no longer blinded.
[02:15:09 -> 02:15:10]  You're
[02:15:10 -> 02:15:18]  No, no.
[02:15:18 -> 02:15:20]  It's a concentration. So, you
[02:15:20 -> 02:15:22]  hold the spell. The spell's still in effect.
[02:15:23 -> 02:15:24]  And you can't hold two
[02:15:24 -> 02:15:31]  concentrations. Yeah.
[02:15:31 -> 02:15:33]  So, if you had to recast it.
[02:15:43 -> 02:15:44]  Go for it.
[02:15:46 -> 02:15:47]  18 hits.
[02:15:53 -> 02:15:55]  You really roll shit on damage.
[02:16:07 -> 02:16:07]  Yeah.
[02:16:07 -> 02:16:08]  I'm gonna move.
[02:16:12 -> 02:16:12]  Excuse me.
[02:16:13 -> 02:16:14]  Din, your turn.
[02:16:23 -> 02:16:28]  I can't believe I rolled two nat 20s.
[02:16:28 -> 02:16:29]  That was crazy.
[02:16:29 -> 02:16:30]  Just imagine.
[02:16:33 -> 02:16:40]  You're after Din.
[02:16:44 -> 02:16:45]  Wait.
[02:16:46 -> 02:16:50]  Did we skip you
[02:16:50 -> 02:16:51]  earlier, Alara?
[02:16:53 -> 02:16:54]  Okay.
[02:16:55 -> 02:16:55]  Okay.
[02:17:00 -> 02:17:01]  Yeah.
[02:17:02 -> 02:17:03]  Hi, Alastair.
[02:17:03 -> 02:17:03]  Yeah.
[02:17:04 -> 02:17:06]  Only the dirty 20 hits.
[02:17:09 -> 02:17:10]  What are you doing?
[02:17:10 -> 02:17:28]  Oh, he's proud.
[02:17:32 -> 02:17:33]  So, that's
[02:17:33 -> 02:17:35]  eight and five damage.
[02:17:39 -> 02:17:40]  Okay, another eight. I didn't get the other one.
[02:17:40 -> 02:17:41]  So, 16. Cool.
[02:17:43 -> 02:17:43]  Yeah.
[02:17:45 -> 02:17:46]  Anything else?
[02:17:49 -> 02:17:50]  Nice.
[02:17:50 -> 02:17:50]  Yeah.
[02:17:51 -> 02:17:53]  Looking a bit fucked up.
[02:17:53 -> 02:17:55]  Um, Alara, it is...
[02:17:57 -> 02:17:58]  What is he?
[02:17:59 -> 02:18:00]  Oh.
[02:18:01 -> 02:18:02]  It's a dryer ball.
[02:18:02 -> 02:18:04]  Um, Alara, it's your turn.
[02:18:10 -> 02:18:11]  Yeah.
[02:18:13 -> 02:18:13]  Does not hit.
[02:18:18 -> 02:18:21]  As you level up, it's easier to hit, but this also has high AC.
[02:18:22 -> 02:18:22]  I see.
[02:18:23 -> 02:18:29]  Um, okay, Witty, it is your turn.
[02:19:27 -> 02:19:28]  Okay.
[02:19:32 -> 02:19:33]  Okay.
[02:19:33 -> 02:19:38]  Um, no worries.
[02:19:39 -> 02:19:40]  Also, I would say...
[02:19:41 -> 02:19:41]  What?
[02:19:44 -> 02:19:49]  Oh, I would say, like, whatever it was your flask you have ready, you probably have that on you as well.
[02:19:53 -> 02:19:54]  Yeah, just roll one.
[02:20:11 -> 02:20:18]  It's, uh, and it's, we're using the 20-24 rule, so it's better than the, for that.
[02:20:19 -> 02:20:20]  I...
[02:20:20 -> 02:20:21]  We...
[02:20:21 -> 02:20:22]  What is...
[02:20:35 -> 02:20:36]  You can give help.
[02:22:05 -> 02:22:06]  Wait, I'll get it for you.
[02:22:07 -> 02:22:09]  Um, I know it's...
[02:22:09 -> 02:22:11]  I'll get you the rules.
[02:22:12 -> 02:22:13]  Class.
[02:22:14 -> 02:22:17]  I think it's a 1d6, but I'll double check.
[02:22:18 -> 02:22:19]  Where is Artificer?
[02:22:21 -> 02:22:22]  Uh, oh yeah, this is...
[02:22:22 -> 02:22:24]  This Artificer just came out, too.
[02:22:24 -> 02:22:24]  That's why.
[02:22:26 -> 02:22:27]  Uh, it's...
[02:22:27 -> 02:22:29]  The Eberron for to the Artificer.
[02:22:31 -> 02:22:33]  Uh, Alchemist.
[02:22:34 -> 02:22:36]  Yeah, it's a...
[02:22:36 -> 02:22:37]  I got it.
[02:22:37 -> 02:22:44]  Uh, it's a 1d6, uh, I mean, I'm just gonna put it in OC chat.
[02:22:45 -> 02:22:46]  This is the table.
[02:22:51 -> 02:22:52]  Boldness.
[02:22:59 -> 02:23:00]  Yeah.
[02:23:09 -> 02:23:09]  Okay.
[02:23:12 -> 02:23:13]  We're setting mood.
[02:23:14 -> 02:23:18]  Um, which would put it into a Isidore's turn.
[02:23:39 -> 02:23:40]  Silvery Barbs.
[02:23:40 -> 02:23:42]  May him re-roll one of the...
[02:23:44 -> 02:23:44]  Yeah.
[02:24:03 -> 02:24:04]  Doesn't hit.
[02:24:29 -> 02:24:30]  Yeah, don't you have an aura?
[02:24:34 -> 02:24:34]  Oh, you don't.
[02:24:34 -> 02:24:37]  Oh, okay.
[02:24:38 -> 02:24:38]  That's why.
[02:25:19 -> 02:25:20]  They, um...
[02:25:21 -> 02:25:22]  Uh, no.
[02:25:22 -> 02:25:24]  I was just seeing if I could do my thing.
[02:25:26 -> 02:25:26]  Um...
[02:25:26 -> 02:25:27]  Let's see.
[02:25:27 -> 02:25:28]  Because I got it back.
[02:25:31 -> 02:25:34]  It's like, do I stab Baradun, or do I throw this?
[02:25:41 -> 02:25:42]  Um...
[02:25:42 -> 02:25:47]  Actually...
[02:25:49 -> 02:25:50]  I am going to stab you.
[02:25:51 -> 02:25:52]  Um...
[02:25:52 -> 02:25:54]  Let's see.
[02:25:54 -> 02:25:57]  I don't have any disadvantage shenanigans on me, right?
[02:25:58 -> 02:25:58]  No.
[02:26:02 -> 02:26:03]  Uh, a 7.
[02:26:03 -> 02:26:04]  Roll the fucking 1.
[02:26:07 -> 02:26:09]  17 on Baradun.
[02:26:09 -> 02:26:09]  Um, okay.
[02:26:10 -> 02:26:11]  So, let's roll the damage.
[02:26:11 -> 02:26:13]  10 plus...
[02:26:13 -> 02:26:18]  Oh, you have a 19?
[02:26:18 -> 02:26:20]  Oh, it was still showing 16.
[02:26:21 -> 02:26:22]  Okay, let's...
[02:26:25 -> 02:26:27]  Okay, because it's showing 16 on my side.
[02:26:27 -> 02:26:28]  Ah, fuck.
[02:26:28 -> 02:26:30]  Okay, let's attack one time.
[02:26:31 -> 02:26:32]  Well...
[02:26:32 -> 02:26:32]  23.
[02:26:32 -> 02:26:33]  23.
[02:26:33 -> 02:26:34]  What's the damage roll from before?
[02:26:34 -> 02:26:36]  22 points of damage.
[02:26:44 -> 02:26:44]  Yeah.
[02:26:45 -> 02:26:46]  You need to roll a con save.
[02:26:47 -> 02:26:48]  Uh, yeah, because it's half.
[02:26:49 -> 02:26:49]  And 11.
[02:26:54 -> 02:26:55]  No, that's a con check.
[02:26:55 -> 02:26:57]  I'll let you roll a con save.
[02:26:57 -> 02:26:57]  I'm being nice.
[02:26:58 -> 02:26:59]  Just hit the save.
[02:27:01 -> 02:27:01]  Okay.
[02:27:02 -> 02:27:02]  Well.
[02:27:04 -> 02:27:05]  Okay.
[02:27:05 -> 02:27:08]  I low-key gave you advantage, but...
[02:27:08 -> 02:27:10]  Um, yeah.
[02:27:10 -> 02:27:12]  So, I lose, um...
[02:27:12 -> 02:27:14]  Whatever that was.
[02:27:14 -> 02:27:14]  I forgot.
[02:27:14 -> 02:27:14]  I forgot.
[02:27:14 -> 02:27:16]  But, yeah.
[02:27:17 -> 02:27:18]  I lose your hex.
[02:27:19 -> 02:27:21]  Um, I have my little flask,
[02:27:21 -> 02:27:22]  but I'm not gonna do
[02:27:22 -> 02:27:24]  anything else.
[02:27:27 -> 02:27:27]  Nick, your turn.
[02:27:57 -> 02:27:58]  Let's go!
[02:27:58 -> 02:28:22]  I think...
[02:28:22 -> 02:28:24]  I think Hunter's Mark should be doubled.
[02:28:25 -> 02:28:26]  So, roll another 1d6.
[02:28:28 -> 02:28:32]  I'm being...
[02:28:32 -> 02:28:33]  18 points of damage.
[02:28:34 -> 02:28:36]  Um, she's on death's door,
[02:28:37 -> 02:28:38]  but, uh, still standing.
[02:28:38 -> 02:28:43]  Um, anything else?
[02:28:44 -> 02:28:52]  No.
[02:29:12 -> 02:29:13]  Din, your turn.
[02:29:16 -> 02:29:17]  Yeah.
[02:29:19 -> 02:29:20]  Very fucked up.
[02:29:37 -> 02:29:38]  Roll damage.
[02:29:49 -> 02:29:50]  How do you do this?
[02:30:25 -> 02:30:27]  I wanna see this after Trust Me.
[02:30:28 -> 02:30:47]  Yeah, combat is over.
[02:30:48 -> 02:30:50]  Um, I assume you killed her.
[02:30:50 -> 02:30:54]  Um, well,
[02:30:54 -> 02:30:55]  he could have done non-lethal.
[02:31:06 -> 02:31:07]  Oh, sweet boy.
[02:31:26 -> 02:31:28]  Yeah, so when you search the body,
[02:31:28 -> 02:31:29]  uh, you find
[02:31:29 -> 02:31:30]  kind of all the tools.
[02:31:30 -> 02:31:35]  I like to use the tools of the trade.
[02:31:35 -> 02:31:37]  Um,
[02:31:37 -> 02:31:38]  this, like,
[02:31:38 -> 02:31:41]  and you find, um,
[02:31:41 -> 02:31:43]  uh, and you find like a note saying,
[02:31:43 -> 02:31:46]  um,
[02:31:46 -> 02:31:46]  like,
[02:31:46 -> 02:31:47]  Hie-uh,
[02:31:47 -> 02:31:50]  Hirda,
[02:31:50 -> 02:31:51]  where you're going.
[02:31:51 -> 02:31:53]  Uh, the name of the place where,
[02:31:53 -> 02:32:00]  uh, Hirda.
[02:32:00 -> 02:32:02]  It looks like she was also
[02:32:02 -> 02:32:15]  going to go after Mary.
[02:32:15 -> 02:32:16]  It doesn't even say the mark,
[02:32:16 -> 02:32:18]  it's just the city, town.
[02:32:18 -> 02:37:21]  This started after, um,
[02:37:21 -> 02:37:23]  you had five rounds of combat
[02:37:23 -> 02:37:25]  which was like literally this was 30
[02:37:25 -> 02:37:27]  seconds after
[02:37:27 -> 02:37:28]  you guys finished
[02:37:28 -> 02:37:31]  your lunch like your supper
[02:37:31 -> 02:37:33]  like it's night
[02:37:33 -> 02:37:35]  you just finished eating
[02:37:35 -> 02:38:25]  so Matt for a reference Alex's character
[02:38:25 -> 02:38:27]  had Lehman's tiny hut
[02:38:27 -> 02:38:29]  as a spell in the previous campaign
[02:38:29 -> 02:38:31]  and it was flavored to look
[02:38:31 -> 02:38:32]  made of like tentacles because
[02:38:32 -> 02:38:34]  that was his aesthetic
[02:38:34 -> 02:38:36]  that was like the creepiest
[02:38:36 -> 02:39:05]  you only got it at like level 5 or something
[02:39:05 -> 02:39:11]  yeah so that was
[02:39:11 -> 02:39:12]  how they used to camp great times
[02:39:12 -> 02:39:13]  great times
[02:39:13 -> 02:39:18]  some of the players would refuse to sleep
[02:39:18 -> 02:39:18]  at it
[02:39:18 -> 02:40:02]  do I sleep?
[02:40:05 -> 02:40:07]  yeah like that's what I was trying to remember
[02:40:07 -> 02:40:10]  because elves typically meditate
[02:40:10 -> 02:40:11]  and it's only like four hours
[02:40:11 -> 02:40:15]  species trait
[02:40:15 -> 02:40:20]  oh you trance
[02:40:20 -> 02:40:23]  you don't need to sleep and magic can't put you to sleep
[02:40:23 -> 02:40:25]  you can finish a long rest in four hours
[02:40:25 -> 02:40:27]  if those hours are spent in a trance like meditation
[02:40:27 -> 02:40:28]  in which you remain conscious
[02:40:28 -> 02:40:37]  yeah
[02:40:37 -> 02:40:49]  all I will say
[02:40:49 -> 02:40:50]  regarding this is
[02:40:50 -> 02:40:52]  if something were to happen
[02:40:52 -> 02:40:54]  I would assume
[02:40:54 -> 02:40:56]  Nyx's passive stat
[02:40:56 -> 02:40:58]  as something I would have to be
[02:40:58 -> 02:41:05]  yeah so like for example
[02:41:05 -> 02:41:07]  if I was trying to like have someone sneak
[02:41:07 -> 02:41:08]  around and Nyx was on guard
[02:41:08 -> 02:41:11]  I would have to be the 14th stealth
[02:41:11 -> 02:41:13]  that's all I'm saying
[02:41:13 -> 02:41:15]  that's all
[02:41:15 -> 02:41:17]  that's all I will say about that
[02:41:17 -> 02:41:19]  you guys can decide that
[02:41:19 -> 02:41:19]  I will
[02:41:19 -> 02:41:22]  but I will use his passives as like
[02:41:22 -> 02:41:22]  the
[02:41:22 -> 02:41:25]  if I ever want to do anything
[02:41:25 -> 02:41:34]  I love that that's how it's done
[02:41:34 -> 02:41:34]  like
[02:41:34 -> 02:41:35]  thanks
[02:41:35 -> 02:41:36]  cool
[02:41:36 -> 02:41:40]  you also have the carriage too
[02:41:40 -> 02:41:40]  right
[02:41:40 -> 02:41:44]  people can sleep in the carriage
[02:41:44 -> 02:41:58]  yeah
[02:41:58 -> 02:41:58]  yeah
[02:43:19 -> 02:43:20]  no
[02:43:20 -> 02:43:22]  they vanish after a long rest
[02:43:22 -> 02:43:23]  they only last
[02:43:23 -> 02:43:25]  they only last between
[02:43:25 -> 02:43:25]  yeah
[02:43:25 -> 02:43:32]  oh yeah
[02:43:32 -> 02:43:35]  no but like between long rest
[02:43:35 -> 02:43:35]  like so
[02:43:35 -> 02:43:37]  whatever elixir you had now
[02:43:37 -> 02:43:38]  if you didn't consume it
[02:43:38 -> 02:43:39]  when you do long rest
[02:43:39 -> 02:43:40]  it goes away
[02:43:40 -> 02:43:41]  and you pick your new ones
[02:43:41 -> 02:43:43]  but as you level up
[02:43:43 -> 02:43:45]  you get more elixirs
[02:43:45 -> 02:43:46]  that's how you get more
[02:43:46 -> 02:43:51]  oh also you can use spell slots
[02:43:51 -> 02:43:52]  to make more too
[02:43:52 -> 02:44:35]  so I'm just gonna
[02:44:35 -> 02:44:38]  one of the things that I'm going to do is
[02:44:38 -> 02:44:39]  things you can do
[02:44:39 -> 02:44:40]  I think this is part of the new rules
[02:44:40 -> 02:44:42]  is you at level two
[02:44:42 -> 02:44:43]  you have replicate magic item
[02:44:43 -> 02:44:48]  for witty
[02:44:48 -> 02:44:50]  so
[02:44:50 -> 02:44:52]  if you know plans
[02:44:52 -> 02:44:53]  and so you can like
[02:44:53 -> 02:44:54]  make a bag of holding and stuff
[02:44:54 -> 02:45:05]  magic isn't permanent
[02:45:05 -> 02:45:06]  when he dies
[02:45:06 -> 02:45:07]  it's 1d4
[02:45:07 -> 02:45:11]  like as long as he's living
[02:45:11 -> 02:45:12]  it exists
[02:45:12 -> 02:45:18]  yeah one or two
[02:45:18 -> 02:45:20]  if he has tinkering tools in hands
[02:45:20 -> 02:45:24]  it's true
[02:45:24 -> 02:45:25]  yeah
[02:45:25 -> 02:45:29]  yeah
[02:45:29 -> 02:45:29]  yeah
[02:45:29 -> 02:45:30]  and like as he levels up
[02:45:30 -> 02:45:31]  he can create more
[02:45:31 -> 02:45:36]  yeah so like
[02:45:36 -> 02:45:38]  yeah so from level two up
[02:45:38 -> 02:45:40]  it's alchemy jug
[02:45:40 -> 02:45:40]  bag of holding
[02:45:40 -> 02:45:41]  cap of water breathing
[02:45:41 -> 02:45:43]  common magic items
[02:45:43 -> 02:45:44]  that isn't a potion
[02:45:44 -> 02:45:45]  scroll or cursed
[02:45:45 -> 02:45:46]  goggles of night
[02:45:46 -> 02:45:47]  manifold tool
[02:45:47 -> 02:45:47]  blah blah blah
[02:45:47 -> 02:45:48]  at level six
[02:45:48 -> 02:45:50]  there's more
[02:45:50 -> 02:45:50]  at level 10
[02:45:50 -> 02:45:51]  there's more
[02:45:51 -> 02:45:52]  14 there's more
[02:45:52 -> 02:46:08]  bonus action
[02:46:08 -> 02:46:09]  bonus action
[02:46:09 -> 02:46:14]  yeah
[02:46:14 -> 02:46:15]  and at a six
[02:46:15 -> 02:46:16]  he can pick which one he wants
[02:46:16 -> 02:46:17]  if he rolls a six
[02:46:17 -> 02:46:34]  oh if they're gas
[02:46:34 -> 02:46:35]  yeah he can hop them
[02:46:35 -> 02:46:37]  if you want them to be poppers
[02:46:37 -> 02:46:39]  go for it
[02:46:39 -> 02:46:43]  i just hear
[02:46:43 -> 02:46:47]  no
[02:46:47 -> 02:46:51]  you can hand them off
[02:46:51 -> 02:46:52]  you can hand them off
[02:46:52 -> 02:46:54]  you can hand them off
[02:46:54 -> 02:46:55]  five feet
[02:46:55 -> 02:46:56]  let's reach
[02:46:56 -> 02:46:57]  yeah
[02:46:57 -> 02:46:58]  so like
[02:46:58 -> 02:47:00]  you could give them for the day
[02:47:00 -> 02:47:01]  when you take the long rest
[02:47:01 -> 02:47:02]  i would say your canisters
[02:47:02 -> 02:47:03]  would just be
[02:47:03 -> 02:47:06]  so like
[02:47:06 -> 02:47:07]  i say you gave one
[02:47:07 -> 02:47:07]  to din
[02:47:07 -> 02:47:09]  um it was like
[02:47:09 -> 02:47:10]  uh whatever
[02:47:10 -> 02:47:11]  din didn't use it
[02:47:11 -> 02:47:12]  you long rest
[02:47:12 -> 02:47:14]  din when din goes
[02:47:14 -> 02:47:14]  the next morning
[02:47:14 -> 02:47:15]  it's just empty
[02:47:15 -> 02:47:17]  and the
[02:47:17 -> 02:47:18]  the logic would be
[02:47:18 -> 02:47:19]  oh it's unstable
[02:47:19 -> 02:47:21]  so i fall apart
[02:47:21 -> 02:47:22]  yeah
[02:47:22 -> 02:47:24]  but like
[02:47:24 -> 02:47:25]  yeah you can make them
[02:47:25 -> 02:47:26]  and hand them out
[02:47:26 -> 02:47:27]  or in combat
[02:47:27 -> 02:47:28]  if they're in
[02:47:28 -> 02:47:28]  uh physical
[02:47:28 -> 02:47:29]  and uh
[02:47:29 -> 02:47:30]  melee range
[02:47:30 -> 02:47:31]  you can give them to it
[02:47:31 -> 02:47:32]  which is five feet
[02:47:32 -> 02:47:36]  i
[02:47:36 -> 02:47:39]  yeah i ignore
[02:47:39 -> 02:47:40]  the attunement rules
[02:47:40 -> 02:47:41]  so don't worry
[02:47:41 -> 02:47:42]  um
[02:47:42 -> 02:47:43]  it
[02:47:43 -> 02:47:44]  that just seems like
[02:47:44 -> 02:47:45]  too much hassle
[02:47:45 -> 02:47:46]  they're like
[02:47:46 -> 02:47:47]  have you been spending
[02:47:47 -> 02:47:48]  special time
[02:47:48 -> 02:47:49]  with your items
[02:47:49 -> 02:47:50]  to become friends
[02:47:50 -> 02:47:56]  with it
[02:47:56 -> 02:48:10]  yeah
[02:48:10 -> 02:48:11]  um
[02:48:11 -> 02:48:12]  roll a d8
[02:48:12 -> 02:48:13]  two pieces of gold
[02:48:13 -> 02:48:21]  um
[02:48:21 -> 02:48:29]  yeah
[02:48:29 -> 02:48:30]  so uh

[02:48:31 -> 02:48:32]  by the fire
[02:48:32 -> 02:48:33]  um

[02:50:26 -> 02:50:27]  before you all
[02:50:27 -> 02:50:42]  do a long
[02:50:42 -> 02:50:43]  rest
[02:50:43 -> 02:50:44]  so

[02:51:07 -> 02:51:53]  yeah
[02:51:53 -> 02:51:54]  because
[02:51:54 -> 02:51:55]  also
[02:51:55 -> 02:51:56]  only needs
[02:51:56 -> 02:52:04]  four hours
[02:52:04 -> 02:52:05]  anyways
[02:52:05 -> 02:52:06]  more than
[02:52:06 -> 02:52:07]  it's more
[02:52:07 -> 02:52:08]  than michelle
[02:52:08 -> 02:52:38]  got
[02:52:38 -> 02:52:39]  uh
[02:52:39 -> 02:52:40]  not
[02:52:40 -> 02:52:41]  this
[02:52:41 -> 02:52:42]  is
[02:52:42 -> 02:52:43]  a
[02:52:43 -> 02:52:59]  good
[02:52:59 -> 02:53:02]  thing
[02:53:02 -> 02:53:03]  but
[02:53:03 -> 02:53:04]  i
[02:53:04 -> 02:53:05]  can't
[02:53:05 -> 02:53:06]  wait
[02:53:06 -> 02:53:07]  to
[02:53:07 -> 02:53:08]  die
[02:53:08 -> 02:53:09]  so
[02:53:09 -> 02:53:10]  you
[02:53:10 -> 02:53:11]  can
[02:53:11 -> 02:53:12]  um
[02:53:12 -> 02:53:13]  you
[02:53:13 -> 02:53:14]  can
[02:53:14 -> 02:53:15]  die
[02:53:15 -> 02:53:16]  i
[02:53:16 -> 02:53:17]  can
[02:53:17 -> 02:53:20]  die
[02:53:20 -> 02:53:22]  i
[02:53:22 -> 02:53:23]  can
[02:53:23 -> 02:53:24]  die
[02:53:24 -> 02:53:25]  i
[02:53:25 -> 02:53:26]  can
[02:53:26 -> 02:53:27]  die
[02:53:27 -> 02:53:28]  i
[02:53:28 -> 02:53:29]  can
[02:53:29 -> 02:53:42]  uh yeah i'm a complete garbage uh yeah so anything anyone wants to do in the morning
[02:53:42 -> 02:54:12]  um before you head off yeah yeah and i will allow like because you're traveling like passively
[02:54:12 -> 02:54:16]  um you can like tinker while you're in the cart so that's basically
[02:54:16 -> 02:54:56]  witty side of the cart just like nice yeah and um yeah so you don't have to like undo it
[02:54:56 -> 02:55:44]  and it heals you all all your long rest check boxes will get reset um uh there's not they don't
[02:55:44 -> 02:55:48]  it's weird because for some features they don't build anything in it's like companions right
[02:55:48 -> 02:55:52]  like if you have like a familiar or a companion
[02:55:52 -> 02:55:53]  there's no way to build anything in it's like companions right like if you have like a familiar
[02:55:53 -> 02:56:12]  you just have to track it it's supposed to be a digital sheet but like yeah yeah
[02:56:12 -> 02:56:30]  yeah yeah yeah and uh one of the things you'll probably have to just not during the session but
[02:56:30 -> 02:56:35]  uh edit your character sheet and then in the builder you can select the everon um
[02:56:35 -> 02:56:42]  artificer and they'll update all your stats but like that that's another thing but anyways we're
[02:56:42 -> 02:56:43]  back to the show
[02:56:43 -> 02:56:47]  back to the morning you've made your things tinkering tools uh you're ready to go anything
[02:56:47 -> 02:57:01]  else was actually i forgot and i was gonna allow you guys to level up but because you said that
[02:57:01 -> 02:57:08]  i'm not i'm a spiteful little bitch
[02:57:08 -> 02:57:27]  i want to level up nah um uh yeah so um anything else before you get on
[02:57:31 -> 02:57:42]  yeah so you continue your journey um alara din and witty are in the carriage um witty is tinkering
[02:57:42 -> 02:57:54]  away din alara probably an awkward silence yeah a lot yeah dan you're just you have two people who
[02:57:54 -> 02:58:01]  are fully concentrated on something else um in the carriage anything if not i'll tell you i'll tell you
[02:58:01 -> 02:58:08]  you just say the next few days go over without incident you're getting closer and closer
[02:58:08 -> 02:58:14]  he is the door you know um i assume you get a little excited as everything's getting more and
[02:58:14 -> 02:58:26]  more familiar um and on the seventh day um we'll say a late morning your crest coming up to the top
[02:58:26 -> 02:58:30]  of the hill um and you know as soon as you hit the top of the hill you know what you're doing you're
[02:58:30 -> 02:58:31]  just going to keep going you're going to keep going uh we're going to keep going and you're
[02:58:31 -> 02:58:31]  going to keep going if you fall you're going to keep going if you fall you're going to keep going
[02:58:31 -> 02:58:36]  you'll see you'll be able to see your village in the distance as you get to
[02:58:36 -> 02:58:42]  the top what you see is kind of a little ways off from your village a small
[02:58:42 -> 02:58:49]  encampment camp still smoke kind of rising from it you see you see the
[02:58:49 -> 02:58:55]  library of the Grand Duke as a small little military base it's kind of
[02:58:55 -> 02:58:59]  impromptu create it there with a bunch of just a few tents there's only 20
[02:58:59 -> 02:59:05]  or so soldiers right and you know not too far off you see also your village
[02:59:05 -> 02:59:22]  ended in the end of today's session you're on the outskirts of here but and
[02:59:22 -> 02:59:30]  actually you all level up so

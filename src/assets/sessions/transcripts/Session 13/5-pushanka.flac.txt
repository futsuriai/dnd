[00:01:32 -> 00:01:32]  It's coming back.
[00:01:33 -> 00:01:34]  Act two, it's coming back.
[00:01:37 -> 00:05:58]  I'm down.
[00:10:59 -> 00:11:25]  You want me to turn you into the dad?
[00:11:26 -> 00:11:26]  Into your dad?
[00:11:33 -> 00:11:34]  Wait, wait.
[00:11:34 -> 00:11:37]  I need to clarify some things.
[00:11:38 -> 00:11:39]  Are you broke,
[00:11:40 -> 00:11:40]  Witty?
[00:11:40 -> 00:11:50]  Oh my god.
[00:11:51 -> 00:11:52]  You're a MAGA Republican?
[00:11:52 -> 00:12:08]  How am I going to get paid
[00:12:08 -> 00:12:09]  if you don't have any money?
[00:12:19 -> 00:12:20]  Okay, okay, okay.
[00:12:21 -> 00:12:24]  Do you have a picture or something?
[00:12:24 -> 00:12:25]  Can you describe him to me?
[00:12:47 -> 00:12:47]  Nice.
[00:13:46 -> 00:13:47]  Okay.
[00:13:47 -> 00:13:48]  Yeah, perfect.
[00:13:49 -> 00:13:50]  Can I cast
[00:13:50 -> 00:13:51]  Disguise Self?
[00:14:11 -> 00:14:12]  This is so interesting.
[00:14:13 -> 00:14:14]  Oh, shit.
[00:14:34 -> 00:14:34]  Yeah.
[00:14:40 -> 00:14:40]  Yeah.
[00:15:01 -> 00:15:04]  Okay, Din has just, like, nailed it.
[00:15:05 -> 00:15:07]  Wait, what's this guy's name again,
[00:15:08 -> 00:15:08]  Witty?
[00:15:09 -> 00:15:10]  Lord Whitman?
[00:15:15 -> 00:15:15]  Okay.
[00:15:16 -> 00:15:23]  What is his first name?
[00:15:23 -> 00:15:37]  I'm the second?
[00:15:46 -> 00:15:46]  Okay.
[00:15:46 -> 00:15:47]  What do you think?
[00:16:31 -> 00:16:32]  I know, it's so interesting.
[00:16:32 -> 00:16:32]  Witty,
[00:16:33 -> 00:16:36]  help me pinpoint
[00:16:36 -> 00:16:38]  this guy's voice.
[00:16:38 -> 00:16:40]  What is he? Kind of like a gruff
[00:16:40 -> 00:16:42]  figure or...
[00:16:42 -> 00:16:48]  Pirate Baron.
[00:16:48 -> 00:16:48]  Okay.
[00:16:55 -> 00:17:08]  Oh, yeah.
[00:17:13 -> 00:17:14]  Classic. Okay.
[00:17:15 -> 00:17:17]  I'm kind of getting, like, a little Wario
[00:17:17 -> 00:17:17]  vibes.
[00:17:27 -> 00:17:28]  Wow.
[00:17:28 -> 00:17:29]  Okay. Let's do it.
[00:17:30 -> 00:17:31]  I'm ready.
[00:17:31 -> 00:17:33]  Din is overconfident,
[00:17:33 -> 00:17:34]  if anything.
[00:17:39 -> 00:17:39]  Yes.
[00:17:41 -> 00:17:43]  Come, Witty.
[00:17:45 -> 00:17:46]  Tally on with me.
[00:18:00 -> 00:18:01]  I
[00:18:01 -> 00:18:05]  walk...
[00:18:05 -> 00:18:12]  Okay, yeah, we did it in an alley, then.
[00:18:12 -> 00:18:12]  Bye.
[00:18:14 -> 00:18:14]  Okay.
[00:18:15 -> 00:18:17]  We're walking right in, okay?
[00:18:17 -> 00:18:19]  Okay, picture this.
[00:18:19 -> 00:18:20]  Okay, we're walking right in,
[00:18:20 -> 00:18:23]  and we're not even gonna stand in line, okay?
[00:18:23 -> 00:18:25]  We're just gonna go straight up to the front of the line
[00:18:25 -> 00:18:26]  if it even existed.
[00:18:26 -> 00:18:28]  Going to the same guy, okay?
[00:18:29 -> 00:18:31]  I'm going, I'm pushing people
[00:18:31 -> 00:18:33]  aside, if it's necessary.
[00:18:37 -> 00:18:38]  Why, yes, this is
[00:18:38 -> 00:18:40]  Lord Whitman,
[00:18:40 -> 00:18:41]  and I'm here with my
[00:18:41 -> 00:18:43]  youngest, most
[00:18:43 -> 00:18:45]  unaccomplished son here.
[00:18:46 -> 00:19:18]  Hooligans, I always call them.
[00:19:18 -> 00:19:18]  Hooligans.
[00:19:24 -> 00:19:25]  Those rich rats.
[00:19:31 -> 00:19:43]  Okay. I'm sorry, did you send me...
[00:19:44 -> 00:19:44]  What?
[00:19:48 -> 00:19:49]  Oh.
[00:19:50 -> 00:19:51]  Okay, okay, okay.
[00:20:05 -> 00:20:12]  Oh. Okay.
[00:20:16 -> 00:20:17]  Let me, like, write a story.
[00:20:19 -> 00:20:30]  If that makes sense.
[00:21:18 -> 00:21:20]  Don't give away my secret
[00:21:20 -> 00:21:21]  there, young lass.
[00:21:53 -> 00:21:56]  My property in this city,
[00:21:56 -> 00:21:56]  is that what you're saying?
[00:21:59 -> 00:22:00]  Oh, sure, yeah, no problem.
[00:22:22 -> 00:22:26]  What, what, what, what's the payment terms?
[00:22:35 -> 00:22:36]  Well, uh,
[00:22:38 -> 00:22:38]  ma'am,
[00:22:40 -> 00:22:41]  can you,
[00:22:41 -> 00:22:44]  can you see my account?
[00:22:45 -> 00:22:46]  Can you see my account
[00:22:46 -> 00:22:47]  in your system?
[00:23:14 -> 00:23:37]  Yes, yes,
[00:23:37 -> 00:23:39]  we'll handle it
[00:23:39 -> 00:24:16]  in the coming...
[00:24:16 -> 00:24:17]  That's my boy.
[00:24:49 -> 00:25:15]  I mean, surely
[00:25:15 -> 00:25:17]  my meager property
[00:25:18 -> 00:25:20]  here in the city
[00:25:20 -> 00:25:22]  is worth significantly more than
[00:25:22 -> 00:25:23]  1,000 gold.
[00:25:53 -> 00:26:00]  Okay.
[00:26:00 -> 00:26:02]  This should be enough for now.
[00:26:02 -> 00:26:03]  We'll get the rest of it handled
[00:26:03 -> 00:26:05]  in the future.
[00:26:11 -> 00:26:14]  Okay, I start signing them
[00:26:14 -> 00:26:16]  in very bad
[00:26:16 -> 00:26:16]  handwriting.
[00:26:28 -> 00:26:48]  I pocket the gold.
[00:26:54 -> 00:26:55]  Okay, I put it in my
[00:26:55 -> 00:26:57]  in my bag.
[00:26:59 -> 00:27:10]  Amazing.
[00:27:11 -> 00:27:11]  Good day.
[00:27:12 -> 00:27:13]  Come along, Witty.
[00:27:16 -> 00:27:18]  I have the gold, and we shall
[00:27:18 -> 00:27:19]  distribute it later.
[00:27:26 -> 00:27:28]  Okay, are we out of the bank?
[00:27:29 -> 00:27:29]  Yeah.
[00:27:35 -> 00:27:36]  Alright, Witty,
[00:27:36 -> 00:27:37]  like, uh,
[00:27:38 -> 00:27:39]  there's probably something we should put a pin in
[00:27:39 -> 00:27:42]  to figure out how, or else you're gonna lose your house.
[00:27:51 -> 00:27:53]  How would your dad
[00:27:53 -> 00:27:54]  know about this situation?
[00:27:55 -> 00:27:56]  Can you contact him at some point?
[00:28:00 -> 00:28:00]  Sure, okay, yeah.
[00:28:01 -> 00:28:01]  Okay, okay.
[00:28:08 -> 00:28:09]  That's alright.
[00:28:22 -> 00:28:24]  That's okay. Why don't I hold on to this
[00:28:24 -> 00:28:26]  gold, um, for the
[00:28:26 -> 00:28:28]  foreseeable future, um,
[00:28:28 -> 00:28:30]  and then, um, we'll
[00:28:30 -> 00:28:32]  try to figure out what we need to do with it later.
[00:28:35 -> 00:28:38]  I love it.
[00:28:39 -> 00:28:41]  It's kind of like, you're my
[00:28:41 -> 00:28:42]  servant, in a way.
[00:28:52 -> 00:28:54]  Damn it, that's true. Okay.
[00:28:57 -> 00:28:58]  Okay.
[00:28:58 -> 00:29:00]  Let's go. I'm Mr. Moneybags now.
[00:29:14 -> 00:29:16]  Oh, we should have,
[00:29:16 -> 00:29:18]  we should have placed an order for the Zeppelin.
[00:29:18 -> 00:29:20]  I totally forgot. Okay, we'll do that when we come back.
[00:29:20 -> 00:29:20]  When we get back.
[00:29:36 -> 00:29:38]  Financial crimes unit.
[00:30:01 -> 00:30:41]  We have, we have, uh, we have enough.
[00:30:44 -> 00:30:44]  We have enough.
[00:30:45 -> 00:30:46]  I don't answer to you.
[00:30:54 -> 00:30:55]  We have a pool,
[00:30:55 -> 00:30:57]  uh, we have, like, we have pretty much
[00:30:57 -> 00:30:59]  the most gold I've ever seen in my entire
[00:30:59 -> 00:31:03]  life. What? What?
[00:31:03 -> 00:31:05]  I don't have to answer to you anymore, okay? I'm, I'm a, I'm a,
[00:31:05 -> 00:31:06]  I'm my own man.
[00:31:27 -> 00:31:29]  We withdrew, uh,
[00:31:29 -> 00:31:31]  a sizable portion, and we could
[00:31:31 -> 00:31:33]  use some help in paying off the loan.
[00:31:33 -> 00:31:35]  We withdrew about 2,000 gold,
[00:31:35 -> 00:31:37]  so, um,
[00:31:37 -> 00:31:39]  it's, it's a little, it's a little tough out there.
[00:31:43 -> 00:31:43]  But,
[00:31:43 -> 00:31:55]  you should believe it, because I've, I've
[00:31:55 -> 00:31:57]  never told a lie to you in my entire,
[00:31:57 -> 00:31:58]  in my entire relationship.
[00:32:03 -> 00:33:04]  Damn it.
[00:33:28 -> 00:33:29]  You caught me.
[00:33:29 -> 00:33:30]  You caught me, bro.
[00:33:31 -> 00:33:32]  It's 3,000.
[00:34:04 -> 00:34:07]  Hold on, I'm trying to switch my, uh,
[00:34:24 -> 00:34:24]  nailed it.
[00:34:25 -> 00:35:16]  Are you, are you saying, Nix, that you can
[00:35:16 -> 00:35:18]  match the funds that we have?
[00:35:22 -> 00:35:23]  I saw you,
[00:35:23 -> 00:35:26]  I saw you a few days ago reach,
[00:35:26 -> 00:35:28]  I reached into your
[00:35:28 -> 00:35:30]  vault, randomly,
[00:35:30 -> 00:35:32]  and pulled out 80 gold, okay?
[00:35:34 -> 00:35:38]  Hey, I think,
[00:35:38 -> 00:35:40]  why am I the one on trial here?
[00:35:40 -> 00:35:42]  And I feel like you're, you've been holding out on us
[00:35:42 -> 00:35:43]  this entire time.
[00:35:45 -> 00:35:48]  Okay, that, that
[00:35:48 -> 00:35:49]  dynamic shouldn't change.
[00:35:50 -> 00:35:52]  This is, this is emergency
[00:35:52 -> 00:35:54]  funds for
[00:35:54 -> 00:35:56]  Witty and
[00:35:56 -> 00:35:58]  I to live off of.
[00:35:58 -> 00:35:59]  Very meager funds, okay?
[00:35:59 -> 00:36:02]  We're gonna, we're gonna, we might, we might start
[00:36:02 -> 00:36:03]  a Zeppelin business
[00:36:03 -> 00:36:06]  in the future, so we're gonna need this, alright?
[00:36:10 -> 00:36:11]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:36:12 -> 00:36:13]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:36:13 -> 00:37:39]  All right.
[00:37:40 -> 00:37:41]  Let's do it.
[00:37:41 -> 00:38:12]  We have, we have too much healing.
[00:38:13 -> 00:39:34]  Yeah, I'm not an animal person.
[00:39:39 -> 00:39:39]  Oh!
[00:41:42 -> 00:41:44]  Can I talk with, um, at some point
[00:41:44 -> 00:41:46]  during the day, can I have a conversation
[00:41:46 -> 00:41:56]  with Alara? Oh.
[00:42:16 -> 00:42:18]  Oh, no, I can, um, I don't mind
[00:42:18 -> 00:42:19]  if everyone overhears.
[00:42:21 -> 00:42:22]  Um,
[00:42:22 -> 00:42:24]  so,
[00:42:24 -> 00:42:26]  I'm writing with Alara.
[00:42:26 -> 00:42:27]  Um, okay.
[00:42:28 -> 00:42:29]  Um,
[00:42:30 -> 00:42:32]  Alara, um,
[00:42:32 -> 00:42:33]  what, what, what do you know,
[00:42:34 -> 00:42:36]  or can you explain your relationship with
[00:42:36 -> 00:42:37]  Proctor Edward?
[00:42:56 -> 00:42:59]  But, what, what do you think of him?
[00:42:59 -> 00:43:00]  Do you like him?
[00:43:14 -> 00:43:16]  Um, I'm, I go into
[00:43:16 -> 00:43:18]  my most, uh,
[00:43:19 -> 00:43:20]  cherub-looking, like,
[00:43:20 -> 00:43:22]  halfling state that I could
[00:43:22 -> 00:43:24]  muster, and
[00:43:24 -> 00:43:26]  I, I walk over
[00:43:26 -> 00:43:28]  the shortnesses and sit
[00:43:28 -> 00:43:30]  beside her, and I put my
[00:43:30 -> 00:43:32]  hand on
[00:43:32 -> 00:43:34]  Alara, uh, Alara's
[00:43:34 -> 00:43:36]  head. Okay.
[00:43:36 -> 00:43:38]  I put it, I try to put it on
[00:43:38 -> 00:43:40]  her, uh,
[00:43:40 -> 00:43:41]  um, her knee.
[00:43:41 -> 00:43:42]  Okay.
[00:43:48 -> 00:43:49]  Look, Alara,
[00:43:50 -> 00:43:52]  there comes a time when
[00:43:52 -> 00:43:54]  we have to face some hard truths
[00:43:54 -> 00:43:56]  in life, and
[00:43:56 -> 00:43:58]  I just need you to be prepared,
[00:43:59 -> 00:44:00]  and I know that we haven't
[00:44:00 -> 00:44:04]  gotten along swimmingly
[00:44:04 -> 00:44:05]  so far, but,
[00:44:06 -> 00:44:08]  um, I overheard
[00:44:08 -> 00:44:10]  something that
[00:44:10 -> 00:44:12]  Proctor Edward said during
[00:44:12 -> 00:44:14]  the party, and
[00:44:14 -> 00:44:16]  I need you to hear it, I need
[00:44:16 -> 00:44:18]  you to trust me, and then
[00:44:18 -> 00:44:20]  I need you to
[00:44:20 -> 00:44:22]  understand what I'm,
[00:44:22 -> 00:44:23]  what I'm, what I'm experiencing.
[00:44:25 -> 00:44:26]  Um, and so,
[00:44:26 -> 00:44:28]  during the party,
[00:44:28 -> 00:44:30]  uh, I stealthily
[00:44:30 -> 00:44:32]  overheard some
[00:44:32 -> 00:44:34]  of the bigwigs
[00:44:34 -> 00:44:36]  at the party, uh,
[00:44:36 -> 00:44:38]  um, it was the
[00:44:38 -> 00:44:40]  Duke and the
[00:44:40 -> 00:44:42]  the Princess
[00:44:42 -> 00:44:44]  and, um,
[00:44:44 -> 00:44:45]  Proctor Edward and
[00:44:45 -> 00:44:48]  Donathan Reeves, um,
[00:44:48 -> 00:44:50]  and they were
[00:44:50 -> 00:44:51]  kind of nefariously
[00:44:51 -> 00:44:53]  talking about,
[00:44:53 -> 00:44:56]  um, the
[00:44:56 -> 00:44:58]  the light crystal
[00:44:58 -> 00:45:00]  shenanigans that we've been
[00:45:00 -> 00:45:02]  dealing with. Um,
[00:45:02 -> 00:45:03]  Proctor Edward is,
[00:45:04 -> 00:45:05]  seems to be intimately aware,
[00:45:06 -> 00:45:08]  and I know that
[00:45:08 -> 00:45:10]  you might, um,
[00:45:10 -> 00:45:12]  I know that you trust him,
[00:45:12 -> 00:45:14]  but he seemed to have been in
[00:45:14 -> 00:45:16]  cahoots with Donathan
[00:45:16 -> 00:45:18]  Reeves and the Duke,
[00:45:18 -> 00:45:19]  and, um,
[00:45:21 -> 00:45:44]  yeah, yeah, I know I
[00:45:44 -> 00:45:45]  haven't really established
[00:45:45 -> 00:45:48]  an, uh, an aura of, uh,
[00:45:48 -> 00:45:49]  trust in the things that I've done
[00:45:49 -> 00:45:50]  so far,
[00:45:50 -> 00:45:52]  but,
[00:45:52 -> 00:45:57]  going through, Baradun's going through a lot of trouble,
[00:45:57 -> 00:45:58]  his head's like,
[00:46:01 -> 00:46:03]  okay,
[00:46:04 -> 00:46:05]  um, I also,
[00:46:06 -> 00:46:08]  I, you know, I, I, I, I
[00:46:08 -> 00:46:10]  relayed this conversation to
[00:46:10 -> 00:46:11]  Nyx, and,
[00:46:11 -> 00:46:12]  um,
[00:46:14 -> 00:46:15]  who else was there? Was Isidore,
[00:46:15 -> 00:46:17]  Isidore was there, too, right after the
[00:46:17 -> 00:46:19]  party. Um,
[00:46:19 -> 00:46:21]  I didn't know how to use the record
[00:46:21 -> 00:46:24]  function on the sending stones, but
[00:46:24 -> 00:46:25]  just, just
[00:46:25 -> 00:46:26]  know this,
[00:46:26 -> 00:46:27]  that,
[00:46:27 -> 00:46:27]  that,
[00:46:27 -> 00:46:29]  that,
[00:46:29 -> 00:46:32]  that.
[00:46:35 -> 00:46:38]  Alari,
[00:46:38 -> 00:46:40]  there's one more thing that I, I, I think
[00:46:40 -> 00:46:42]  you should know, and I know, I know
[00:46:42 -> 00:46:44]  that you don't trust me or anything, but
[00:46:44 -> 00:46:46]  he specifically, Edward
[00:46:46 -> 00:46:48]  specifically mentioned
[00:46:48 -> 00:46:50]  you in this conversation,
[00:46:50 -> 00:46:52]  and he,
[00:46:52 -> 00:46:54]  he said that
[00:46:54 -> 00:46:56]  he had, um,
[00:46:56 -> 00:46:58]  he had you wrapped around
[00:46:58 -> 00:46:59]  his finger,
[00:47:00 -> 00:47:00]  um,
[00:47:00 -> 00:47:06]  okay, I'm just,
[00:47:07 -> 00:47:07]  oh,
[00:47:07 -> 00:47:07]  oh,
[00:47:08 -> 00:47:10]  I feel like I haven't done a good job
[00:47:10 -> 00:47:13]  of explaining the gravity of the situation to you.
[00:47:36 -> 00:47:52]  This is, you know, I'm taking that to heart,
[00:47:52 -> 00:47:56]  kind of reevaluating my whole MO here.
[00:47:57 -> 00:47:58]  All I need to do,
[00:47:58 -> 00:48:00]  I attempt to take her hand one last time.
[00:48:08 -> 00:48:10]  As one last plea,
[00:48:10 -> 00:48:15]  I'm going to cast my Disguise Self again.
[00:48:17 -> 00:48:22]  And in the manner,
[00:48:22 -> 00:48:25]  I'm going to disguise myself as Proctor Edward,
[00:48:25 -> 00:48:29]  and I'm going to repeat the words that I had heard
[00:48:29 -> 00:48:31]  and I had relayed to her.
[00:48:31 -> 00:48:35]  And I would like to roll a performance check
[00:48:35 -> 00:48:37]  to see how well I do.
[00:48:38 -> 00:48:39]  Is that fair?
[00:48:47 -> 00:48:47]  Yeah.
[00:49:03 -> 00:49:03]  Yeah.
[00:49:06 -> 00:49:07]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:49:07 -> 00:49:08]  I agree with it.
[00:49:08 -> 00:49:09]  Okay, that's fine.
[00:49:09 -> 00:49:12]  So do I just roll a d20,
[00:49:12 -> 00:49:13]  or can I roll my ability?
[00:49:15 -> 00:49:16]  Okay, okay, okay.
[00:49:16 -> 00:49:17]  I thought you said flat,
[00:49:17 -> 00:49:18]  so I was just kind of confused.
[00:49:22 -> 00:49:24]  Okay, I mean, it is flat.
[00:49:24 -> 00:49:24]  It's 10.
[00:49:28 -> 00:49:29]  Middle of the road.
[00:49:30 -> 00:49:32]  Middle of the road performance here.
[00:49:34 -> 00:49:34]  Okay.
[00:49:35 -> 00:49:37]  And I wrap up,
[00:49:37 -> 00:49:38]  and I think like,
[00:49:38 -> 00:49:39]  okay, that's going to do it.
[00:49:39 -> 00:49:40]  That's going to convince her.
[00:49:46 -> 00:49:56]  You are done.
[00:50:23 -> 00:50:24]  Just, just,
[00:50:24 -> 00:50:24]  just,
[00:50:25 -> 00:50:25]  careful.
[00:50:25 -> 00:50:26]  You, you, you,
[00:50:26 -> 00:50:27]  you understand that I,
[00:50:27 -> 00:50:27]  I,
[00:50:28 -> 00:50:28]  I,
[00:50:29 -> 00:50:32]  I just want you to be careful.
[00:50:33 -> 00:50:33]  You know that,
[00:50:33 -> 00:50:34]  that,
[00:50:34 -> 00:50:34]  that is true, right?
[00:50:50 -> 00:50:51]  I think that's successful.
[00:50:57 -> 00:51:03]  That was a,
[00:51:04 -> 00:51:04]  that was a,
[00:51:04 -> 00:51:08]  yeah.
[00:51:09 -> 00:51:13]  It's perfect.
[00:51:13 -> 00:51:13]  It's a,
[00:51:13 -> 00:51:15]  I think I nailed it.
[00:52:17 -> 00:52:19]  Yeah, I don't have anything.
[00:55:49 -> 00:55:49]  Wait.
[01:01:52 -> 01:02:24]  Is it a,
[01:02:24 -> 01:02:25]  is it a baby,
[01:02:25 -> 01:02:27]  or a toddler?
[01:02:27 -> 01:02:29]  It's a baby.
[01:02:32 -> 01:02:33]  Okay.
[01:02:37 -> 01:02:39]  I want to play with the baby.
[01:02:53 -> 01:02:54]  Oh, is he sleeping right now?
[01:02:54 -> 01:02:55]  Sorry about that.
[01:02:57 -> 01:02:57]  I, I have,
[01:02:58 -> 01:02:58]  yeah.
[01:03:07 -> 01:03:08]  Do you want to,
[01:03:08 -> 01:03:08]  like,
[01:03:09 -> 01:03:09]  yeah.
[01:03:09 -> 01:03:10]  Do you want to approach this
[01:03:10 -> 01:03:13]  from a out-of-character perspective?
[01:03:13 -> 01:03:13]  Do you want to,
[01:03:13 -> 01:03:14]  do you guys,
[01:03:14 -> 01:03:14]  do you,
[01:03:14 -> 01:03:15]  do you guys want to typically approach this
[01:03:15 -> 01:03:17]  like we're interrogating this person,
[01:03:17 -> 01:03:18]  or do we want to,
[01:03:18 -> 01:03:21]  do we want to accept it?
[01:03:21 -> 01:03:22]  Because we can do like the,
[01:03:22 -> 01:03:23]  the insight and,
[01:03:23 -> 01:03:23]  you know,
[01:03:23 -> 01:03:23]  the,
[01:03:23 -> 01:03:23]  the,
[01:03:23 -> 01:03:23]  the,
[01:03:23 -> 01:03:23]  the,
[01:03:23 -> 01:03:23]  the,
[01:03:23 -> 01:03:23]  the,
[01:03:23 -> 01:03:25]  the arcana check and everything
[01:03:25 -> 01:03:26]  if you want to go through it.
[01:03:36 -> 01:03:36]  Okay.
[01:03:36 -> 01:03:36]  Yeah.
[01:03:46 -> 01:03:47]  Passive perception.
[01:04:32 -> 01:04:33]  Yeah, I like that.
[01:04:33 -> 01:04:45]  Everyone else is oblivious.
[01:04:51 -> 01:04:51]  Oh,
[01:04:52 -> 01:04:52]  I like that.
[01:04:57 -> 01:04:58]  Oh,
[01:04:58 -> 01:04:59]  good roll.
[01:05:06 -> 01:05:07]  Shit.
[01:05:07 -> 01:05:07]  Oh,
[01:05:07 -> 01:05:07]  shit.
[01:05:47 -> 01:05:47]  Wait.
[01:06:01 -> 01:06:02]  Oh my God.
[01:06:02 -> 01:06:03]  That's genius.
[01:06:05 -> 01:06:16]  That's hilarious.
[01:07:14 -> 01:07:14]  Well,
[01:07:14 -> 01:07:14]  I mean,
[01:07:15 -> 01:07:15]  on the other side.
[01:07:57 -> 01:07:58]  Yeah.
[01:07:58 -> 01:07:58]  I'll,
[01:07:58 -> 01:08:05]  I'll,
[01:08:05 -> 01:08:06]  I'll try to be like,
[01:08:06 -> 01:08:08]  I'm kind of peeking around.
[01:08:08 -> 01:08:15]  I'm really interested in the baby because the din loves babies loves children.
[01:08:15 -> 01:08:17]  So I'm trying to get it like a closer look.
[01:08:17 -> 01:08:19]  I'm kind of like peeking over Isidore's,
[01:08:19 -> 01:08:21]  but I'm like sitting on his side,
[01:08:21 -> 01:08:21]  I guess.
[01:08:24 -> 01:08:25]  Yeah.
[01:08:48 -> 01:08:49]  This guy,
[01:09:39 -> 01:09:40]  Jesus.
[01:10:02 -> 01:10:03]  Casual,
[01:10:03 -> 01:10:03]  casual.
[01:10:49 -> 01:10:50]  So tense.
[01:11:02 -> 01:11:03]  Oh my God.
[01:11:09 -> 01:11:10]  Oh my God.
[01:11:15 -> 01:11:16]  I hope the baby is also an enemy.
[01:11:21 -> 01:11:26]  The demon,
[01:11:26 -> 01:11:27]  demon baby.
[01:11:56 -> 01:11:56]  Oh my God.
[01:12:38 -> 01:12:39]  Fourth level.
[01:13:06 -> 01:13:07]  Wow.
[01:15:25 -> 01:15:25]  Okay.
[01:15:25 -> 01:15:26]  We,
[01:15:26 -> 01:15:27]  we only see this bandit receiver,
[01:15:28 -> 01:15:28]  right?
[01:15:28 -> 01:15:29]  Bandit deceiver.
[01:15:29 -> 01:15:29]  Sorry.
[01:15:29 -> 01:15:30]  Right.
[01:15:30 -> 01:15:30]  That's the only.
[01:15:31 -> 01:15:31]  Okay.
[01:15:33 -> 01:15:34]  Okay.
[01:15:34 -> 01:15:36]  I'm going to whip out my,
[01:15:36 -> 01:15:38]  my double scimitars.
[01:15:41 -> 01:15:47]  I cast my phantom hex on her.
[01:15:48 -> 01:15:51]  Um,
[01:15:51 -> 01:15:53]  this is just,
[01:15:53 -> 01:15:54]  this is just a bonus.
[01:15:54 -> 01:15:54]  This is like,
[01:15:54 -> 01:15:55]  uh,
[01:15:55 -> 01:15:57]  this is like hex except my own version.
[01:15:57 -> 01:15:58]  It's uh,
[01:15:59 -> 01:15:59]  um,
[01:15:59 -> 01:16:03]  she just has disadvantage on ability checks.
[01:16:03 -> 01:16:04]  Um,
[01:16:08 -> 01:16:08]  no,
[01:16:08 -> 01:16:08]  no,
[01:16:08 -> 01:16:09]  this is,
[01:16:09 -> 01:16:09]  this is like,
[01:16:09 -> 01:16:10]  um,
[01:16:10 -> 01:16:10]  this is like hex.
[01:16:10 -> 01:16:12]  This is like the hex cast.
[01:16:12 -> 01:16:12]  Um,
[01:16:12 -> 01:16:12]  it's a,
[01:16:12 -> 01:16:13]  it's a,
[01:16:13 -> 01:16:17]  it's a bonus action and it every time until the spell ends.
[01:16:18 -> 01:16:18]  Um,
[01:16:19 -> 01:16:23]  I deal extra one D six psychic damage on the target whenever I hit it with an attack.
[01:16:28 -> 01:16:28]  Yeah,
[01:16:28 -> 01:16:29]  I can,
[01:16:29 -> 01:16:29]  I can,
[01:16:29 -> 01:16:31]  I can combo this with other people.
[01:16:31 -> 01:16:33]  I just don't know what you guys are.
[01:16:33 -> 01:16:34]  If you could,
[01:16:34 -> 01:16:35]  if you guys have any like,
[01:16:35 -> 01:16:35]  um,
[01:16:36 -> 01:16:38]  ability checks that you use with your spells,
[01:16:38 -> 01:16:38]  just let me know.
[01:16:38 -> 01:16:40]  Cause I can make her have a disadvantage on it.
[01:16:45 -> 01:16:45]  Yeah.
[01:16:47 -> 01:16:47]  I,
[01:16:47 -> 01:16:48]  yeah.
[01:16:50 -> 01:16:50]  Yeah.
[01:16:50 -> 01:16:51]  I think like,
[01:16:51 -> 01:16:52]  yeah.
[01:16:52 -> 01:16:52]  So I'll go ahead.
[01:16:53 -> 01:16:54]  What were you gonna say?
[01:17:14 -> 01:17:15]  I think it's like,
[01:17:16 -> 01:17:17]  yeah.
[01:17:19 -> 01:17:19]  Yeah.
[01:17:19 -> 01:17:19]  Yeah.
[01:17:19 -> 01:17:20]  Yeah.
[01:17:21 -> 01:17:21]  Yeah.
[01:17:21 -> 01:17:22]  Yeah.
[01:17:22 -> 01:17:22]  Yeah.
[01:17:22 -> 01:17:38]  Yeah.
[01:17:38 -> 01:17:38]  Yeah.
[01:17:38 -> 01:17:38]  Yeah.
[01:17:38 -> 01:17:38]  Yeah.
[01:17:38 -> 01:17:38]  Yeah.
[01:17:38 -> 01:17:38]  Yeah.
[01:17:38 -> 01:17:38]  Yeah.
[01:17:38 -> 01:17:38]  Yeah.
[01:17:38 -> 01:17:38]  Yeah.
[01:17:38 -> 01:17:41]  Yeah.
[01:17:41 -> 01:17:42]  I know you're supposed to like,
[01:17:42 -> 01:17:42]  like when,
[01:17:42 -> 01:17:44]  whenever they ask for like a save or something,
[01:17:44 -> 01:17:46]  that's when usually we can,
[01:17:46 -> 01:17:47]  we can use it.
[01:17:50 -> 01:17:51]  Yeah.
[01:17:51 -> 01:17:52]  So I don't know.
[01:17:52 -> 01:17:55]  Usually it's like wisdom or something or things that could happen.
[01:17:55 -> 01:17:56]  So I'm,
[01:17:56 -> 01:17:56]  I'm just gonna,
[01:17:56 -> 01:18:05]  it's just a disadvantage.
[01:18:07 -> 01:18:07]  Yeah.
[01:18:10 -> 01:18:10]  He can,
[01:18:10 -> 01:18:11]  he can,
[01:18:11 -> 01:18:11]  she can break concentration.
[01:18:12 -> 01:18:12]  Yeah.
[01:18:19 -> 01:18:19]  Um,
[01:18:20 -> 01:18:20]  anyway.
[01:18:20 -> 01:18:21]  Uh,
[01:18:21 -> 01:18:21]  okay.
[01:18:21 -> 01:18:21]  Yeah.
[01:18:21 -> 01:18:21]  I'll,
[01:18:21 -> 01:18:22]  I'll just choose wisdom,
[01:18:22 -> 01:18:22]  I guess.
[01:18:23 -> 01:18:23]  Um,
[01:18:23 -> 01:18:24]  and then I'm gonna,
[01:18:24 -> 01:18:25]  I'm gonna,
[01:18:25 -> 01:18:28]  I'm gonna do my attack with the scimitars.
[01:18:29 -> 01:18:29]  Um,
[01:18:29 -> 01:18:31]  yeah,
[01:18:31 -> 01:18:32]  let me move into range.
[01:18:32 -> 01:18:32]  Sorry.
[01:18:33 -> 01:18:33]  Uh,
[01:18:33 -> 01:18:34]  let me go to the screen.
[01:18:36 -> 01:18:36]  Can I,
[01:18:36 -> 01:18:37]  can I stand right here?
[01:18:45 -> 01:18:47]  Bonus fire damage.
[01:18:49 -> 01:18:49]  Okay.
[01:18:50 -> 01:18:50]  Um,
[01:18:51 -> 01:18:51]  I've never,
[01:18:51 -> 01:18:52]  I've never,
[01:18:52 -> 01:18:55]  I've never gone through this before with you,
[01:18:55 -> 01:18:55]  Bobby,
[01:18:55 -> 01:18:55]  but,
[01:18:56 -> 01:18:56]  um,
[01:18:56 -> 01:18:57]  this is,
[01:18:57 -> 01:18:58]  this is the process through,
[01:18:58 -> 01:19:00]  which I have my attacks.
[01:19:01 -> 01:19:01]  Um,
[01:19:01 -> 01:19:03]  I have,
[01:19:03 -> 01:19:04]  um,
[01:19:05 -> 01:19:05]  I,
[01:19:05 -> 01:19:06]  these are both light weapons.
[01:19:07 -> 01:19:08]  Um,
[01:19:08 -> 01:19:08]  so I,
[01:19:08 -> 01:19:09]  I'm double,
[01:19:09 -> 01:19:09]  double wielding,
[01:19:09 -> 01:19:10]  uh,
[01:19:10 -> 01:19:10]  two scimitars.
[01:19:11 -> 01:19:11]  Um,
[01:19:11 -> 01:19:12]  they're both light weapons.
[01:19:12 -> 01:19:13]  So that means I can attack,
[01:19:13 -> 01:19:14]  uh,
[01:19:15 -> 01:19:15]  once with,
[01:19:15 -> 01:19:16]  uh,
[01:19:16 -> 01:19:18]  my regular attack and then once with my bonus attack,
[01:19:18 -> 01:19:20]  but I just use my bonus attack with,
[01:19:20 -> 01:19:21]  for hex.
[01:19:21 -> 01:19:22]  So I can't do that this turn.
[01:19:23 -> 01:19:23]  Um,
[01:19:23 -> 01:19:25]  but I have the,
[01:19:25 -> 01:19:28]  I have the weapon mastery with scimitar,
[01:19:28 -> 01:19:30]  from my barred subclass.
[01:19:30 -> 01:19:33]  That means I have the weapon mastery of Nick,
[01:19:33 -> 01:19:39]  and that allows me to essentially turn that extra attack into like a,
[01:19:40 -> 01:19:41]  into like a regular attack.
[01:19:41 -> 01:19:41]  So I have,
[01:19:45 -> 01:19:45]  I,
[01:19:45 -> 01:19:46]  I,
[01:19:47 -> 01:19:47]  yeah,
[01:19:47 -> 01:19:47]  yeah.
[01:19:47 -> 01:19:48]  And I,
[01:19:48 -> 01:19:48]  it's,
[01:19:48 -> 01:19:48]  since it's,
[01:19:48 -> 01:19:49]  uh,
[01:19:49 -> 01:19:49]  since it's,
[01:19:49 -> 01:19:50]  uh,
[01:19:50 -> 01:19:50]  uh,
[01:19:50 -> 01:19:51]  okay.
[01:19:51 -> 01:19:53]  I'm just trying to double check out and make sure I know that working
[01:19:53 -> 01:19:54]  Nick's Nick says,
[01:19:54 -> 01:19:57]  when you make the extra attack of the light property,
[01:19:57 -> 01:20:01]  you can make it as part of the attack action instead of as a bonus.
[01:20:01 -> 01:20:01]  Action.
[01:20:02 -> 01:20:03]  So typically,
[01:20:03 -> 01:20:03]  um,
[01:20:03 -> 01:20:05]  if I didn't cast my hex,
[01:20:05 -> 01:20:07]  I would have three attacks with my scimitar.
[01:20:08 -> 01:20:09]  Um,
[01:20:09 -> 01:20:11]  since I casted my hex,
[01:20:11 -> 01:20:13]  I only have two attacks with my scimitar.
[01:20:13 -> 01:20:14]  Does that make sense?
[01:20:19 -> 01:20:19]  Yeah,
[01:20:19 -> 01:20:19]  I know.
[01:20:19 -> 01:20:20]  It's like,
[01:20:20 -> 01:20:21]  it's not showing up.
[01:20:21 -> 01:20:23]  It's supposed to show up when you hop,
[01:20:23 -> 01:20:26]  when you hover over the weapon in my character sheet.
[01:20:26 -> 01:20:27]  Um,
[01:20:27 -> 01:20:30]  but right now the only thing you can see is this little red,
[01:20:30 -> 01:20:31]  this red star.
[01:20:31 -> 01:20:32]  Yeah.
[01:20:32 -> 01:20:34]  And then you'll see in the note.
[01:20:34 -> 01:20:34]  Yeah.
[01:20:34 -> 01:20:35]  So there's,
[01:20:35 -> 01:20:38]  there's a few different properties that are intersecting here.
[01:20:38 -> 01:20:38]  Sorry.
[01:20:38 -> 01:20:39]  I'm just doing this all in my turn,
[01:20:40 -> 01:20:40]  by the way,
[01:20:40 -> 01:20:40]  but,
[01:20:40 -> 01:20:41]  um,
[01:20:41 -> 01:20:41]  it's,
[01:20:41 -> 01:20:46]  it's a light attack property that is always exists for when you're
[01:20:46 -> 01:20:46]  doing two handed.
[01:20:46 -> 01:20:47]  So I'm doing a two,
[01:20:47 -> 01:20:48]  two weapon,
[01:20:48 -> 01:20:48]  two weapon fighting.
[01:20:49 -> 01:20:50]  I have two weapon,
[01:20:50 -> 01:20:51]  um,
[01:20:51 -> 01:20:52]  fighting style.
[01:20:52 -> 01:20:52]  So that,
[01:20:52 -> 01:20:54]  that lets me add my,
[01:20:54 -> 01:20:55]  uh,
[01:20:55 -> 01:20:57]  my proficiency to my damage roles,
[01:20:57 -> 01:20:58]  I think.
[01:20:58 -> 01:21:03]  And then the Nick property is the mastery that lets me attack again,
[01:21:03 -> 01:21:03]  basically.
[01:21:03 -> 01:21:04]  So when I'm,
[01:21:04 -> 01:21:06]  when I'm maxed out as this character,
[01:21:07 -> 01:21:08]  I should have like four,
[01:21:08 -> 01:21:09]  four attacks.
[01:21:20 -> 01:21:20]  Yeah.
[01:21:20 -> 01:21:21]  So that's,
[01:21:21 -> 01:21:22]  that's traditionally.
[01:21:22 -> 01:21:24]  So traditionally you would only have three,
[01:21:24 -> 01:21:25]  like one,
[01:21:25 -> 01:21:25]  once you,
[01:21:25 -> 01:21:27]  you would have essentially like another attack.
[01:21:27 -> 01:21:27]  Like you,
[01:21:27 -> 01:21:30]  you attack once with your main hand and then once with your bonus
[01:21:30 -> 01:21:30]  attack,
[01:21:31 -> 01:21:31]  the Nick,
[01:21:32 -> 01:21:36]  the Nick prop mastery moves that bonus attack to like a weird,
[01:21:36 -> 01:21:38]  like non bonus attack.
[01:21:42 -> 01:21:43]  Yeah.
[01:21:44 -> 01:21:44]  Yeah.
[01:21:45 -> 01:21:46]  Yeah.
[01:21:51 -> 01:21:51]  Two attacks.
[01:21:51 -> 01:21:52]  Yeah.
[01:21:52 -> 01:21:55]  This essentially it's it's it's I think it's there was a way to make two
[01:21:55 -> 01:21:58]  weapon fighting a little bit better in the new edition.
[01:21:59 -> 01:22:00]  So it's a little bit,
[01:22:00 -> 01:22:02]  it's a little bit catch up cause I it's low damage,
[01:22:02 -> 01:22:03]  but it can do it.
[01:22:03 -> 01:22:04]  So what I'm,
[01:22:04 -> 01:22:07]  what essentially I'm trying to do is I'm trying to stack the hex damage
[01:22:07 -> 01:22:11]  with as many weapon attacks as I can muster in a single turn.
[01:22:12 -> 01:22:13]  Um,
[01:22:13 -> 01:22:14]  okay.
[01:22:15 -> 01:22:15]  Okay.
[01:22:15 -> 01:22:16]  Perfect.
[01:22:16 -> 01:22:19]  And then the last thing I apologize for so many things,
[01:22:19 -> 01:22:21]  if I make a successful attack,
[01:22:21 -> 01:22:23]  then I can use my bard,
[01:22:23 -> 01:22:25]  my sword barred like spells.
[01:22:25 -> 01:22:31]  I can use my bardic inspiration to add whatever flourish that I want.
[01:22:32 -> 01:22:33]  Like I have the defensive flourish,
[01:22:33 -> 01:22:34]  mobile portion sounds.
[01:22:34 -> 01:22:34]  Okay.
[01:22:34 -> 01:22:35]  Thank you.
[01:22:35 -> 01:22:35]  Thanks.
[01:22:35 -> 01:22:35]  Sorry.
[01:22:35 -> 01:22:36]  Sorry.
[01:22:36 -> 01:22:36]  I know there's a lot.
[01:22:44 -> 01:22:44]  Yes.
[01:22:44 -> 01:22:45]  Yeah.
[01:22:45 -> 01:22:46]  I'm keeping track of everything.
[01:22:46 -> 01:22:49]  Okay.
[01:22:49 -> 01:22:49]  Perfect.
[01:22:49 -> 01:22:50]  Okay.
[01:22:50 -> 01:22:51]  So I have similar to,
[01:22:51 -> 01:22:53]  I'll do my first attack for the seminar.
[01:22:57 -> 01:22:58]  It's a 14.
[01:23:00 -> 01:23:01]  Shit.
[01:23:01 -> 01:23:01]  Okay.
[01:23:03 -> 01:23:03]  Then,
[01:23:04 -> 01:23:04]  uh,
[01:23:08 -> 01:23:08]  Oh,
[01:23:08 -> 01:23:09]  my flourishes doesn't matter.
[01:23:09 -> 01:23:10]  I don't have to hit them.
[01:23:10 -> 01:23:11]  Right.
[01:23:11 -> 01:23:11]  I can still,
[01:23:13 -> 01:23:14]  Oh no,
[01:23:14 -> 01:23:14]  I have to,
[01:23:15 -> 01:23:16]  I have to hit them.
[01:23:16 -> 01:23:16]  Nevermind.
[01:23:17 -> 01:23:17]  I have to hit.
[01:23:17 -> 01:23:18]  Nevermind.
[01:23:18 -> 01:23:18]  Nevermind.
[01:23:19 -> 01:23:19]  It might,
[01:23:19 -> 01:23:21]  my walking speed increases no matter what,
[01:23:21 -> 01:23:22]  but,
[01:23:22 -> 01:23:22]  um,
[01:23:22 -> 01:23:23]  I have to hit them.
[01:23:23 -> 01:23:23]  Okay.
[01:23:23 -> 01:23:24]  I'll,
[01:23:24 -> 01:23:25]  I'm going to go for the second stack here.
[01:23:28 -> 01:23:29]  I got a 14 again.
[01:23:31 -> 01:23:32]  Cool.
[01:23:36 -> 01:23:37]  Yep.
[01:23:37 -> 01:24:12]  I'm putting this here.
[01:26:24 -> 01:26:26]  The battlefield is very symmetrical right now.
[01:26:26 -> 01:26:27]  I kind of like it.
[01:27:47 -> 01:27:48]  It's just like a flavor.
[01:27:48 -> 01:27:48]  Thing,
[01:27:48 -> 01:27:49]  Matt.
[01:27:49 -> 01:27:49]  Like,
[01:27:49 -> 01:27:50]  um,
[01:27:50 -> 01:27:51]  so it's like,
[01:27:51 -> 01:27:52]  you're still using spell slots,
[01:27:52 -> 01:27:57]  but you're saying that it's yeah.
[01:27:57 -> 01:27:57]  Yeah.
[01:29:28 -> 01:29:29]  Yeah.
[01:31:30 -> 01:31:32]  I'm also reading all of your guys's like spell sheets.
[01:32:18 -> 01:32:19]  That's good though.
[01:32:19 -> 01:32:20]  Isn't that,
[01:32:20 -> 01:32:21]  doesn't it make it easier for you?
[01:32:21 -> 01:32:23]  Cause you don't have to waste action on it.
[01:32:28 -> 01:32:28]  Oh,
[01:32:28 -> 01:32:29]  Oh,
[01:32:29 -> 01:32:30]  it's actually okay.
[01:32:30 -> 01:32:30]  Sorry.
[01:32:30 -> 01:32:30]  Sorry.
[01:32:30 -> 01:32:30]  Okay.
[01:32:30 -> 01:32:31]  Okay.
[01:32:31 -> 01:32:47]  My,
[01:32:47 -> 01:32:48]  my holy shit.
[01:33:38 -> 01:33:39]  I see.
[01:33:39 -> 01:33:41]  And you do have a shield.
[01:34:17 -> 01:34:17]  Dang.
[01:34:17 -> 01:34:19]  He also has SAP on that war pick.
[01:34:20 -> 01:34:20]  Yes.
[01:34:20 -> 01:34:35]  That there's that mastery before.
[01:34:37 -> 01:34:37]  Yeah.
[01:34:57 -> 01:34:57]  Bobby does,
[01:34:57 -> 01:34:57]  does she,
[01:34:57 -> 01:35:00]  does she still look like she does to us at the start?
[01:35:00 -> 01:35:02]  Or is she completely different?
[01:35:12 -> 01:35:13]  Yeah.
[01:35:25 -> 01:35:25]  Is,
[01:35:25 -> 01:35:28]  is witty and didn't like still sexually attracted to her.
[01:35:57 -> 01:35:58]  I think it's just one from what it says.
[01:35:58 -> 01:36:01]  It says if you hit a creature with a war pick that creature has
[01:36:01 -> 01:36:04]  disadvantage on its next attack role before the start of your next turn.
[01:36:40 -> 01:36:41]  What does Moomdean do again?
[01:38:50 -> 01:38:51]  It's really interesting.
[01:38:51 -> 01:39:10]  Interesting.
[01:39:24 -> 01:39:25]  But does that,
[01:39:25 -> 01:39:26]  does that work?
[01:39:26 -> 01:39:26]  Like if you,
[01:39:27 -> 01:39:28]  if you only attack once during your turn?
[01:39:44 -> 01:39:45]  Oh,
[01:39:45 -> 01:39:45]  okay.
[01:39:45 -> 01:39:46]  Can you,
[01:39:46 -> 01:39:46]  can you like,
[01:39:47 -> 01:39:48]  can you,
[01:39:48 -> 01:39:50]  can you dual wield hand crossbows?
[01:39:50 -> 01:40:01]  Okay.
[01:40:01 -> 01:40:01]  Okay.
[01:40:01 -> 01:40:02]  Okay.
[01:40:02 -> 01:40:02]  Good.
[01:40:02 -> 01:40:02]  Yeah.
[01:40:04 -> 01:40:04]  No.
[01:40:04 -> 01:40:04]  Yeah.
[01:40:04 -> 01:40:05]  That seems really useful.
[01:40:06 -> 01:40:07]  Cause if you do have dual then,
[01:40:13 -> 01:40:13]  Oh yeah.
[01:40:18 -> 01:40:19]  It's a bonus action.
[01:40:21 -> 01:40:21]  Yeah.
[01:40:36 -> 01:40:38]  It's a damage one D six,
[01:40:38 -> 01:40:39]  right?
[01:40:42 -> 01:40:42]  Yeah.
[01:40:42 -> 01:40:42]  That's,
[01:40:43 -> 01:40:45]  that's the only like good thing about Rangers.
[01:40:45 -> 01:40:45]  I thought.
[01:40:51 -> 01:40:51]  Yeah.
[01:41:06 -> 01:41:08]  Rules as written rules as written.
[01:41:41 -> 01:41:41]  We,
[01:41:41 -> 01:41:43]  we used to be so much slower and like,
[01:41:44 -> 01:41:46]  now we're like marginally a bit faster now.
[01:41:54 -> 01:41:54]  Yeah.
[01:42:00 -> 01:42:01]  I,
[01:42:01 -> 01:42:04]  I think Mark's turns were the funniest last campaign.
[01:42:04 -> 01:42:04]  Cause I,
[01:42:04 -> 01:42:08]  we would have to roll 20 different things to get his little bonus.
[01:42:09 -> 01:42:36]  That was crazy.
[01:43:04 -> 01:43:05]  Okay.
[01:43:05 -> 01:43:06]  Um,
[01:43:06 -> 01:43:07]  I will,
[01:43:07 -> 01:43:08]  as my bonus action,
[01:43:08 -> 01:43:12]  I will cast healing word on my dear friend,
[01:43:12 -> 01:43:16]  Alara and the healing word is like,
[01:43:16 -> 01:43:17]  uh,
[01:43:17 -> 01:43:20]  I literally want to say to her while I'm healing her,
[01:43:20 -> 01:43:20]  I was like,
[01:43:20 -> 01:43:25]  you please trust me about Edward.
[01:43:27 -> 01:43:27]  Okay.
[01:43:29 -> 01:43:30]  Okay.
[01:43:30 -> 01:43:39]  I did a second level,
[01:43:39 -> 01:43:39]  but I guess that's fine.
[01:43:39 -> 01:43:40]  Yeah.
[01:43:40 -> 01:43:41]  I'll just do a second level.
[01:43:49 -> 01:43:50]  Yeah.
[01:43:50 -> 01:43:54]  And she has a renewed level of trust in Baradun also from.
[01:44:01 -> 01:44:02]  Okay.
[01:44:05 -> 01:44:06]  I'm going to do my,
[01:44:07 -> 01:44:09]  my double a similar attack now.
[01:44:13 -> 01:44:13]  Okay.
[01:44:13 -> 01:44:15]  I'm only getting four teens now.
[01:44:15 -> 01:44:19]  So apparently that 16,
[01:44:21 -> 01:44:22]  thank God.
[01:44:22 -> 01:44:22]  Okay.
[01:44:22 -> 01:44:23]  I'm going to,
[01:44:23 -> 01:44:25]  I'm going to also cast my flourish.
[01:44:25 -> 01:44:27]  So I'm going to,
[01:44:27 -> 01:44:28]  uh,
[01:44:33 -> 01:44:35]  ideal extra damage with my bardic inspiration.
[01:44:35 -> 01:44:37]  And I add that to my AC.
[01:44:39 -> 01:44:40]  Um,
[01:44:40 -> 01:44:41]  yeah,
[01:44:41 -> 01:44:42]  yeah,
[01:44:42 -> 01:44:42]  yeah.
[01:44:43 -> 01:44:44]  One D six.
[01:44:45 -> 01:44:45]  Um,
[01:44:45 -> 01:44:46]  I don't know the order.
[01:44:46 -> 01:44:47]  Should I do this?
[01:44:47 -> 01:44:48]  Like I got a five there.
[01:44:49 -> 01:44:49]  Um,
[01:44:50 -> 01:44:53]  so five damage and then I'm rolling my scimitar damage here.
[01:44:56 -> 01:44:58]  So seven plus five,
[01:44:58 -> 01:44:58]  12.
[01:44:58 -> 01:44:58]  Okay.
[01:44:58 -> 01:44:58]  Okay.
[01:44:58 -> 01:44:58]  Okay.
[01:44:58 -> 01:44:58]  Okay.
[01:44:58 -> 01:44:58]  Okay.
[01:44:58 -> 01:44:59]  Okay.
[01:44:59 -> 01:44:59]  Okay.
[01:44:59 -> 01:44:59]  Okay.
[01:44:59 -> 01:44:59]  Okay.
[01:44:59 -> 01:44:59]  Okay.
[01:44:59 -> 01:44:59]  Okay.
[01:44:59 -> 01:44:59]  Okay.
[01:44:59 -> 01:44:59]  Okay.
[01:44:59 -> 01:44:59]  Okay.
[01:44:59 -> 01:44:59]  Okay.
[01:45:00 -> 01:45:00]  Okay.

[01:45:00 -> 01:45:00]  Okay.
[01:45:01 -> 01:45:01]  Perfect.
[01:45:04 -> 01:45:04]  Uh,
[01:45:04 -> 01:45:06]  I'm standing right in front of her.
[01:45:08 -> 01:45:28]  It was,
[01:45:28 -> 01:45:28]  it was the trust.
[01:45:29 -> 01:45:29]  It was,
[01:45:30 -> 01:45:33]  it was the trust instilled in her that boosted it up to 24.
[01:45:38 -> 01:45:39]  It might have to upgrade like the,
[01:45:40 -> 01:45:40]  uh,
[01:45:40 -> 01:45:40]  your,
[01:45:40 -> 01:45:41]  your page.
[01:45:47 -> 01:45:51]  It shows,
[01:45:51 -> 01:45:51]  it shows 13.
[01:45:51 -> 01:45:52]  I had to,
[01:45:52 -> 01:45:52]  I had to update.
[01:45:52 -> 01:45:54]  I had to update the webpage,
[01:45:54 -> 01:45:55]  reload the webpage.
[01:45:55 -> 01:45:55]  I mean,
[01:46:21 -> 01:46:22]  I'm so sorry,
[01:46:22 -> 01:46:23]  uh,
[01:46:23 -> 01:46:23]  Bobby,
[01:46:23 -> 01:46:23]  I,
[01:46:23 -> 01:46:25]  I totally forgot about the hex that's still on her.
[01:46:26 -> 01:46:26]  So,
[01:46:26 -> 01:46:26]  uh,
[01:46:26 -> 01:46:30]  let me just roll it real quick.
[01:46:30 -> 01:46:31]  It's two,
[01:46:31 -> 01:46:33]  two damage of psychic.
[01:46:33 -> 01:54:46]  So funny.
[01:56:56 -> 01:56:57]  Nice.
[01:56:57 -> 01:56:57]  Okay.
[01:57:59 -> 01:58:00]  Sorry.
[01:58:01 -> 01:58:01]  Sorry.
[01:58:04 -> 01:58:04]  I'm sorry.
[01:58:05 -> 01:58:06]  That was me.
[01:58:06 -> 01:58:07]  It was my fault.
[01:58:07 -> 01:58:07]  My fault.
[01:58:07 -> 01:58:07]  I'm sorry.
[01:58:09 -> 01:58:12]  Sorry.
[01:58:12 -> 01:58:12]  Sorry.
[01:58:12 -> 01:58:13]  Sorry.
[01:58:33 -> 01:58:34]  Nice.
[01:59:04 -> 01:59:05]  I thought it's a,
[01:59:05 -> 01:59:06]  it's a concentration.
[01:59:06 -> 01:59:07]  I thought it's not a concentration.
[01:59:13 -> 01:59:14]  Well,
[01:59:14 -> 01:59:15]  unless you,
[01:59:15 -> 01:59:20]  yeah,
[01:59:23 -> 01:59:24]  it's like,
[01:59:25 -> 01:59:26]  yeah,
[01:59:26 -> 01:59:38]  I think it's 10.
[01:59:42 -> 01:59:42]  Yeah.
[01:59:42 -> 01:59:42]  Yeah.
[01:59:43 -> 01:59:53]  Let's go.
[01:59:57 -> 01:59:57]  Nice.
[02:00:07 -> 02:00:08]  Okay.
[02:00:31 -> 02:00:32]  That one has like a count.
[02:00:35 -> 02:00:36]  You have two of them.
[02:01:10 -> 02:01:10]  Twice.
[02:01:13 -> 02:01:14]  No,
[02:01:14 -> 02:01:16]  you can only twice per long rest.
[02:01:38 -> 02:01:41]  There's a tracker on your character sheet for dreadful strike.
[02:01:43 -> 02:01:43]  Okay.
[02:01:44 -> 02:01:44]  Yeah.
[02:01:49 -> 02:01:49]  All right.
[02:01:50 -> 02:01:50]  We're going,
[02:01:51 -> 02:01:51]  uh,
[02:01:51 -> 02:01:52]  I'm twirling up my,
[02:01:52 -> 02:01:53]  my blades again.
[02:01:54 -> 02:01:54]  Um,
[02:01:54 -> 02:01:56]  I don't have to heal anyone.
[02:01:56 -> 02:01:59]  So I'm going to go straight up into three attacks.
[02:02:00 -> 02:02:00]  On,
[02:02:00 -> 02:02:00]  on her.
[02:02:01 -> 02:02:02]  Uh,
[02:02:02 -> 02:02:02]  okay.
[02:02:02 -> 02:02:03]  So I'm just going to do it.
[02:02:05 -> 02:02:05]  Uh,
[02:02:08 -> 02:02:10]  can I just like hit this three times?
[02:02:10 -> 02:02:14]  Like 15,
[02:02:15 -> 02:02:19]  18 and 16.
[02:02:23 -> 02:02:23]  Okay.
[02:02:24 -> 02:02:25]  Um,
[02:02:29 -> 02:02:29]  uh,
[02:02:29 -> 02:02:30]  I'm going to use another,
[02:02:30 -> 02:02:31]  uh,
[02:02:31 -> 02:02:33]  defensive flourish for one of them.
[02:02:35 -> 02:02:35]  Um,
[02:02:35 -> 02:02:35]  okay.
[02:02:35 -> 02:02:36]  Let me,
[02:02:36 -> 02:02:37]  let me do the attacks first.
[02:02:37 -> 02:02:37]  Uh,
[02:02:37 -> 02:02:38]  okay.
[02:02:38 -> 02:02:41]  Attack damage is nine.
[02:02:41 -> 02:02:44]  And then the defensive hit,
[02:02:44 -> 02:02:44]  uh,
[02:02:44 -> 02:02:46]  flourish is one D six.
[02:02:46 -> 02:02:49]  So that's two,
[02:02:49 -> 02:02:50]  uh,
[02:02:50 -> 02:02:52]  11 damage for one of the attacks.
[02:02:53 -> 02:02:54]  And,
[02:02:54 -> 02:02:55]  um,
[02:02:55 -> 02:02:56]  uh,
[02:02:57 -> 02:02:57]  and sorry,
[02:02:58 -> 02:02:58]  phantom hex too.
[02:02:58 -> 02:02:59]  Sorry.
[02:02:59 -> 02:02:59]  I have to do that one.
[02:03:00 -> 02:03:00]  Okay.
[02:03:02 -> 02:03:02]  Okay.
[02:03:03 -> 02:03:03]  Uh,
[02:03:03 -> 02:03:05]  13 damage for attack one.
[02:03:05 -> 02:03:08]  And then I will do a second attack.
[02:03:10 -> 02:03:13]  It's four plus phantom hex.
[02:03:13 -> 02:03:13]  Again,
[02:03:13 -> 02:03:16]  seven damage for the second attack.
[02:03:26 -> 02:03:27]  Yeah.
[02:03:27 -> 02:03:28]  Seven for the,
[02:03:28 -> 02:03:32]  uh,
[02:03:32 -> 02:03:32]  what did I say?
[02:03:32 -> 02:03:34]  The first one was 13 and seven.
[02:03:39 -> 02:03:40]  Oh yeah.
[02:03:40 -> 02:03:40]  I'm sorry.
[02:03:41 -> 02:03:41]  I I'm,
[02:03:41 -> 02:03:42]  I'm looking at the dice and I'm not looking.
[02:03:42 -> 02:03:43]  Okay.
[02:03:43 -> 02:03:43]  You're right.
[02:03:43 -> 02:03:45]  It is 10 for the second attack.
[02:03:45 -> 02:03:45]  Yeah.
[02:03:54 -> 02:03:54]  Yeah.
[02:03:55 -> 02:03:55]  Yeah.
[02:03:56 -> 02:03:57]  I have 16 now.
[02:03:57 -> 02:03:58]  Yeah.
[02:04:08 -> 02:04:08]  Um,
[02:04:08 -> 02:04:09]  no,
[02:04:09 -> 02:04:09]  I'll,
[02:04:09 -> 02:04:09]  I'll stick.
[02:04:10 -> 02:04:10]  I'll,
[02:04:10 -> 02:04:10]  I'll,
[02:04:10 -> 02:04:11]  I'll,
[02:04:11 -> 02:04:11]  I'll,
[02:04:11 -> 02:04:11]  I'll move.
[02:04:12 -> 02:04:12]  If I,
[02:04:12 -> 02:04:14]  if I move slightly like South of her,
[02:04:14 -> 02:04:15]  will that trigger an attack?
[02:04:16 -> 02:04:16]  Okay.
[02:04:16 -> 02:04:16]  Okay.
[02:04:17 -> 02:04:17]  As long as I don't,
[02:04:17 -> 02:04:18]  I'll leave.
[02:04:19 -> 02:04:20]  Okay.
[02:04:22 -> 02:04:22]  Okay.
[02:04:23 -> 02:04:24]  I'll try to move it a little bit.
[02:04:24 -> 02:04:24]  So,
[02:04:24 -> 02:04:25]  okay.
[02:04:25 -> 02:04:26]  That's perfect.
[02:04:51 -> 02:04:54]  What if you are already a blind character?
[02:04:54 -> 02:04:55]  Like what would,
[02:04:56 -> 02:05:01]  like a,
[02:05:01 -> 02:05:03]  like a daredevil character?
[02:05:20 -> 02:06:27]  Yeah,
[02:06:27 -> 02:06:28]  it sucks.
[02:06:42 -> 02:06:43]  You can,
[02:06:43 -> 02:06:43]  you,
[02:06:43 -> 02:06:44]  you can also like,
[02:06:44 -> 02:06:45]  uh,
[02:06:45 -> 02:06:47]  add cantrips that are damaged cantrips.
[02:06:47 -> 02:06:48]  Um,
[02:06:48 -> 02:06:50]  and that will,
[02:06:51 -> 02:06:53]  yeah.
[02:06:54 -> 02:06:55]  And you can like,
[02:06:55 -> 02:06:56]  you can attack,
[02:06:56 -> 02:06:57]  you can throw your dagger too,
[02:06:57 -> 02:06:58]  or something like,
[02:07:45 -> 02:07:46]  okay,
[02:07:46 -> 02:07:47]  good.
[02:07:47 -> 02:07:50]  I like it.
[02:07:50 -> 02:07:52]  Try to look for the cone overlay.
[02:07:52 -> 02:07:53]  If that exists.
[02:07:54 -> 02:07:55]  Oh,
[02:07:55 -> 02:07:55]  line overlay.
[02:07:55 -> 02:08:14]  Sorry.
[02:08:14 -> 02:08:22]  Acid.
[02:09:06 -> 02:09:07]  I should have chosen.
[02:09:11 -> 02:09:12]  Okay.
[02:09:12 -> 02:09:13]  It's okay.
[02:09:14 -> 02:09:15]  Yeah.
[02:09:46 -> 02:11:32]  Yeah.
[02:11:32 -> 02:11:33]  On me,
[02:11:33 -> 02:11:36]  on me.
[02:11:36 -> 02:11:37]  Uh,
[02:11:37 -> 02:11:37]  can I,
[02:11:37 -> 02:11:37]  can I,
[02:11:37 -> 02:11:38]  um,
[02:11:38 -> 02:11:40]  can I cast a silvery,
[02:11:40 -> 02:11:41]  silvery barbs?
[02:11:41 -> 02:11:42]  To,
[02:11:42 -> 02:11:43]  uh,
[02:11:43 -> 02:11:44]  to reroll one of them?
[02:11:44 -> 02:11:46]  Yeah.
[02:11:46 -> 02:11:47]  Yeah.
[02:11:47 -> 02:11:48]  I have,
[02:11:48 -> 02:11:49]  I have,
[02:11:49 -> 02:11:58]  I have one spell slot.
[02:11:58 -> 02:11:59]  I have two spell slots left.
[02:11:59 -> 02:12:00]  It's probably too OP,
[02:12:00 -> 02:12:01]  but yeah,
[02:12:01 -> 02:12:02]  I'm only using it for this situation.
[02:12:02 -> 02:12:09]  Well,
[02:12:09 -> 02:12:10]  I mean,
[02:12:10 -> 02:12:11]  actually,
[02:12:11 -> 02:12:12]  what's what,
[02:12:12 -> 02:12:13]  what's up to you,
[02:12:13 -> 02:12:18]  Bobby?
[02:12:18 -> 02:12:26]  Do you,
[02:12:26 -> 02:12:27]  do you want to,
[02:12:27 -> 02:12:28]  do you want to play with silvery bomb?
[02:12:28 -> 02:12:29]  Okay.
[02:12:29 -> 02:12:46]  No,
[02:12:46 -> 02:12:47]  no,
[02:12:47 -> 02:12:48]  whatever,
[02:12:48 -> 02:12:49]  whatever,
[02:12:49 -> 02:12:50]  whatever makes sense in your head in terms of balance.
[02:12:50 -> 02:12:51]  Yeah.
[02:12:51 -> 02:12:52]  Okay.
[02:12:52 -> 02:13:15]  Now I would,
[02:13:15 -> 02:13:16]  that doesn't hit,
[02:13:16 -> 02:13:17]  but the other one hit,
[02:13:17 -> 02:13:23]  right?
[02:13:23 -> 02:13:24]  Okay.
[02:13:24 -> 02:13:25]  Okay.
[02:13:25 -> 02:13:28]  Okay.
[02:13:28 -> 02:13:31]  I have no more reactions.
[02:13:31 -> 02:13:32]  Yeah.
[02:13:32 -> 02:13:39]  Yeah.
[02:13:39 -> 02:13:40]  Uh,
[02:13:40 -> 02:13:41]  myself,
[02:13:41 -> 02:13:44]  I'll give it to myself.
[02:13:44 -> 02:13:47]  Yeah.
[02:13:47 -> 02:13:48]  No hit,
[02:13:48 -> 02:13:49]  no hit.
[02:13:49 -> 02:13:50]  Okay.
[02:13:50 -> 02:13:51]  Yeah.
[02:13:51 -> 02:13:52]  I think that would have been a permadeath too.
[02:13:52 -> 02:13:57]  Holy shit.
[02:13:57 -> 02:13:58]  You should roll it anyways.
[02:13:58 -> 02:13:59]  Just want to see what,
[02:13:59 -> 02:14:00]  let's see what it is.
[02:14:00 -> 02:14:01]  Okay.
[02:14:01 -> 02:14:02]  Okay.
[02:14:02 -> 02:14:08]  Okay.
[02:14:08 -> 02:14:09]  Okay.
[02:14:09 -> 02:14:10]  Okay.
[02:14:10 -> 02:14:11]  Okay.
[02:14:11 -> 02:14:12]  Okay.
[02:14:12 -> 02:14:16]  Okay.
[02:14:16 -> 02:14:17]  Okay.
[02:14:17 -> 02:14:21]  That's a,
[02:14:21 -> 02:14:22]  that's a lot of,
[02:14:22 -> 02:14:23]  that's a lot of fives.
[02:14:23 -> 02:14:34]  Damn
[02:14:35 -> 02:14:42]  these bees of sweat going down Baradun's.
[02:16:16 -> 02:16:17]  all right.
[02:16:17 -> 02:16:18]  Um,
[02:16:18 -> 02:16:20]  I somehow still have my Phantom hex up,
[02:16:20 -> 02:16:22]  so I'm going to go for the attack.

[02:20:26 -> 02:20:33]  to think of your turn as um in the action economy there's a lot of other things you can do like you
[02:20:33 -> 02:20:40]  can also use some of your you can give the help action yeah you can there's other actions you can

[02:20:56 -> 02:21:03]  if you want to learn something about them um yeah some interesting things and i i think we're gonna
[02:21:03 -> 02:21:09]  we're gonna have to like maybe we'll have to change up some of your cantrips so that you
[02:21:09 -> 02:21:22]  have some sort of damaging option at your i do yeah yeah
[02:21:22 -> 02:21:28]  what if there's like a crazy like prep guy there's so many things that when you wake up you have to go

[02:32:13 -> 02:33:01]  oh okay uh i just want to say thanks you know nix i think we were all kind of beguiled by
[02:33:01 -> 02:33:08]  by her and i'm glad you have a very distrustful approach to everyone
[02:33:08 -> 02:33:20]  it's gonna keep us alive compliment sandwich
[02:33:20 -> 02:34:38]  yeah humans kind of suck
[02:34:43 -> 02:35:32]  okay admit that um we were taken in by this weary traveler
[02:35:32 -> 02:35:38]  let our guard down maybe you should give like a like a protocol here or something
[02:35:38 -> 02:35:46]  the baby the baby got me too i mean it looked pretty real
[02:35:46 -> 02:36:47]  yeah that's true that's true yep yeah din din nods in agreement and also
[02:36:47 -> 02:36:47]  pointedly looks like he's not a good bounty hunter he's not a good bounty hunter he's not a good
[02:36:47 -> 02:39:10]  vampire he's not a good player he's not a good
[02:39:10 -> 02:39:27]  it was very comfortable it was nice it was nice it was nice it was good
[02:39:27 -> 02:39:36]  just just for sleeping arrangements here
[02:39:36 -> 02:39:37]  so we are in the perquè
[02:39:37 -> 02:39:45]  um nicks uh do you like do you like sleep like like we do how does how does this work
[02:39:45 -> 02:39:55]  yeah do we need someone to like to keep watch over us or can you just
[02:39:55 -> 02:40:03]  yeah like how does that work
[02:40:03 -> 02:40:31]  is he is he like conscious is he conscious when he's like doing his oh so does that does that
[02:40:31 -> 02:40:38]  serve as as our lookout like going forward so that does that work okay so we don't have to say
[02:40:38 -> 02:41:04]  like okay this guy's gonna keep keep watching oh okay okay he has a 14 passive perception okay
[02:41:04 -> 02:41:29]  oh okay no that's perfect so then i don't we don't i don't have to worry about it we can just
[02:41:29 -> 02:41:37]  conk off whenever we go to sleep nicks is nicks is on it yeah okay
[02:41:38 -> 02:41:42]  uh oh yeah
[02:41:42 -> 02:41:46]  okay i called dibs on the carriage
[02:41:46 -> 02:43:06]  i'm a very small person so i don't i i can take up a little thing um yeah i think you can keep
[02:43:06 -> 02:43:18]  making elixirs like as long as you have the the mats you can yeah you can just start building it
[02:43:18 -> 02:45:14]  up oh that's so annoying um is that a permanent like creation what does that mean oh so like
[02:45:14 -> 02:45:27]  any number of these magic items exist like that wow there's no there's so much potential here it's
[02:45:27 -> 02:45:58]  kind of crazy yeah oh god okay that's awesome and i i do believe one of the changes they made
[02:45:58 -> 02:46:03]  in artifice or for the new version is that or for alchemists i don't know if it's artifice or
[02:46:03 -> 02:46:09]  alchemist but it's no it's no longer a an action to consume one of these elixirs it's a bonus
[02:46:09 -> 02:46:13]  action yeah that makes it a lot easier to use because i know that was a big pain point before
[02:46:18 -> 02:46:24]  um would it be fair i mean again this is more of a flavor thing and this might change the balance a
[02:46:24 -> 02:46:29]  little bit but would it be fair like to say that he could like like instead of instead of these
[02:46:29 -> 02:46:38]  instead of these are drinks these are kind of gaseous concoctions could he like kind of yeah yeah
[02:46:39 -> 02:46:46]  could he could he like theoretically could he theoretically throw throw one of these like at at us
[02:46:46 -> 02:46:49]  like oh my god okay
[02:46:53 -> 02:47:58]  yeah uh yeah yeah yeah that makes sense okay that's cool okay awesome
[02:47:59 -> 02:48:04]  um did uh did the loot produce any gold from the dead body
[02:48:14 -> 02:48:17]  yeah I never roll a d8 that's crazy
[02:48:20 -> 02:48:23]  I got a two you son of a bitch
[02:48:26 -> 02:48:50]  we have to bury
[02:48:50 -> 02:49:02]  oh okay okay okay that's that's a good point that's a good point
[02:49:30 -> 02:54:48]  that's fair what was that uh nope so eloquent yeah nice uh Matt by the way if you uh when you
[02:54:48 -> 02:54:53]  click on that long rest button that's how you that's how you actually reset everything on the
[02:54:53 -> 02:54:58]  character sheet do you see it yeah that will
[02:54:58 -> 02:55:02]  yeah I'll heal you to Max and it'll also reset your spell slots
[02:55:07 -> 02:55:19]  yeah yeah this is gonna I think you're gonna have to like I what I would do is I would add like all
[02:55:19 -> 02:55:26]  the different types of elixirs as temporary inventory items and then just change the the
[02:55:26 -> 02:55:32]  number of that during the day to help you keep track like so if you know that you have this many
[02:55:32 -> 02:55:36]  boldness or this many Resiliences or this many pots
[02:55:36 -> 02:55:37]  um
[02:55:38 -> 02:55:42]  and then that way at least you can like see it I don't know if there's an easier way to handle that
[02:55:42 -> 02:56:03]  in this thing yeah yeah you can you can use either like your your own notes or you can use something
[02:56:03 -> 02:56:09]  in D&D Beyond like there's a there's a whole notes tab there that you can add um you can also use it
[02:56:09 -> 02:56:21]  right yeah and sometimes that's nice because like some of the items you can you can like they
[02:56:21 -> 02:56:25]  actually impact your stats if you if you needed to um so it's kind of interesting
[02:56:26 -> 02:56:53]  um yeah I want to level up DM
[02:56:57 -> 02:57:07]  I shut up I was not
[02:57:18 -> 02:59:34]  that was meta commentary that was not in character yeah you're welcome everyone that was me

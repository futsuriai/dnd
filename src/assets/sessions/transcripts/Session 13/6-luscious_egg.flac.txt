[01:06:49 -> 01:07:03]  like uh arm distance from her maybe maybe
[01:07:03 -> 01:07:03]  no
[01:07:03 -> 01:09:58]  how are you doing this gently
[01:09:58 -> 01:10:14]  oh yeah for sure gently
[01:10:14 -> 01:10:16]  all right
[01:10:16 -> 01:15:00]  you need to start the session you're fucked up dirty funny oh wow what if we don't want to
[01:15:00 -> 01:24:20]  augie looks like he has initiative
[01:24:20 -> 01:30:52]  yay
[01:30:52 -> 01:31:03]  um well first i'm going to um it's not an action it's just like a b like um my channel divinity
[01:31:03 -> 01:31:16]  um not i don't think so i try it's it's i don't think i think it's just like i activate it
[01:31:16 -> 01:32:05]  let me see yeah i'd google the same thing it's not it's not clear um well i i as their actions
[01:32:05 -> 01:32:07]  yeah
[01:32:11 -> 01:32:17]  i thought i thought it was like a bonus action or something at most okay never mind scratch by just
[01:32:17 -> 01:32:29]  what i was about to do no it's not a bonus it's not a bonus action it's an action yeah there was
[01:32:29 -> 01:32:38]  action so like before a fight would be great but not during um so we'll do a good old just a regular
[01:32:38 -> 01:32:52]  attack uh does a 24 hit and what am i sorry what i have two
[01:32:53 -> 01:32:56]  here one second
[01:32:56 -> 01:33:04]  i like two different roles for some reason
[01:33:04 -> 01:33:06]  the one what
[01:33:06 -> 01:33:13]  okay
[01:33:13 -> 01:33:14]  yeah but the hindsight
[01:33:14 -> 01:33:21]  was
[01:33:21 -> 01:33:34]  the debate higher if i threw it that doesn't make sense to me
[01:33:34 -> 01:33:38]  oh wait i think i do have it wait one second i do not remember if i have a shield equipped
[01:33:38 -> 01:33:40]  give me one second
[01:33:40 -> 01:33:47]  that makes sense yeah i do never mind okay so
[01:33:47 -> 01:33:48]  okay
[01:33:48 -> 01:33:55]  no no my war pick
[01:33:55 -> 01:34:06]  okay i'm gonna do that and plus with the the bad attack i'm adding a divine smite
[01:34:06 -> 01:34:20]  and then i will divine smite so 19 points of damage
[01:34:20 -> 01:34:29]  yeah so uh next role uh will be a disadvantage uh wait it's that yeah the next uh the bandits
[01:34:29 -> 01:34:40]  next attack role will be in disadvantage uh on eighth next attack roll yeah
[01:34:40 -> 01:36:47]  yeah it hurts
[01:36:47 -> 01:41:10]  i think you should
[01:41:10 -> 01:41:46]  what do you
[01:41:46 -> 01:42:15]  oh yeah there's like yeah
[01:42:15 -> 01:42:29]  yeah well the the fight with the dragon where we had a surprise round and all my all my hits were
[01:42:29 -> 01:42:35]  critical so it was like four quick dice that did like a hundred points of damage was like ridiculous
[01:42:59 -> 01:43:35]  yeah oh i'm sure she'll be like okay
[01:43:35 -> 01:44:33]  boy
[01:44:33 -> 01:52:26]  i realized lara was that far that's she okay um how's she how's this person looking
[01:52:33 -> 01:52:43]  interesting um one second i'm just saying if i did do a bonus action or not
[01:52:48 -> 01:52:56]  okay i'm gonna do um i'm gonna cast divine favor on myself
[01:52:57 -> 01:52:59]  uh which gives me an extra
[01:52:59 -> 01:53:07]  and one of the biggest challenges that i'm going to have is to hit them okay
[01:53:07 -> 01:53:10]  i'm gonna um i'm gonna do a extra 1d4 of radiant damage on hits
[01:53:10 -> 01:53:25]  how long does it last one minute okay perfect and then i'm going to again attack with my warm pick
[01:53:25 -> 01:53:31]  22 so i do this
[01:53:31 -> 01:53:37]  stick i will obviously do a divine smite as well uh this one doesn't use a spell slot perfect so do this and then gimme one second do this as well
[01:53:37 -> 01:53:38]  perfect so do this and then gimme one second do this as well
[01:53:38 -> 01:53:38]  perfect so do this and then give me one second do this as well
[01:53:38 -> 01:53:59]  do this as well roll no but the mine favorite did it roll no it adds a 1d4 okay 4 so it's
[01:53:59 -> 01:54:58]  15. make sense no it's like no uh oh okay okay no i'm good another whole person i'm
[01:54:58 -> 01:55:12]  assuming oh no it's like it's uh not of course nat 20 on this one can i head back
[01:55:12 -> 01:56:21]  if you like i am okay just this one oh one second did you roll was it an attack roll
[01:56:21 -> 01:59:26]  by the way okay no i'm just asking yeah it doesn't just say i was yeah
[01:59:26 -> 02:10:29]  hit her with uh my war pick for the 19 hit god he's sort of a simple man you see something
[02:10:29 -> 02:10:41]  he needs to hit he hits it uh nine then i'm gonna do my last divine smite 15 and i still
[02:10:41 -> 02:11:01]  have my divine favor so you can't say that oh and then she has this advantage on her
[02:11:01 -> 02:11:02]  next attack
[02:11:02 -> 02:11:40]  roll yeah no not the little guy yeah was it a crit what was it let's see no i got it
[02:11:40 -> 02:11:55]  right away oh my god it was a double crit that's crazy
[02:11:55 -> 02:21:34]  it makes sense like you like a chemist wouldn't be like
[02:21:34 -> 02:23:25]  ready to be like go like without any prep sorry does anyone need like is it is baron still like
[02:23:25 -> 02:23:33]  not doing well you're fine well you didn't get hit like it cut out when i was bringing
[02:23:33 -> 02:23:48]  arthur out you didn't get hit like that okay oh yeah it's true amazing okay
[02:23:48 -> 02:24:01]  so i know my spell salts as it is so let me just do war pick i know if 14 doesn't hit
[02:24:01 -> 02:24:08]  do you have any bonus action i can do
[02:24:08 -> 02:24:10]  let's see
[02:24:10 -> 02:24:13]  i don't think so
[02:24:13 -> 02:24:39]  i don't think so just see um um no i don't have an aura it's level five no pretty sure
[02:24:39 -> 02:24:45]  no no then that gets crazy yeah when i get my aura that's wild let me just double check
[02:24:45 -> 02:24:47]  but i'm like eight like i'm almost sure
[02:24:47 -> 02:24:53]  no sorry level six yeah
[02:24:53 -> 02:25:02]  and then that gets really good also all right that's all i can do for now um
[02:25:02 -> 02:25:10]  trying to think we're not any bonus actions either okay i'm going to stay as is as a blocker
[02:25:10 -> 02:28:43]  between the thief and the others no not anymore no oh my god thank god
[02:28:58 -> 02:29:36]  watch us miss every every attack until her next turn
[02:29:36 -> 02:29:37]  oh wow
[02:29:37 -> 02:31:00]  yes there's like you're gonna hit little long
[02:31:00 -> 02:33:25]  it doesn't it never crosses our mind lovely my village it's true
[02:33:25 -> 02:33:29]  yes the door is looking around yes they're looking around and then panics to the group
[02:33:29 -> 02:33:31]  like turns panicky the grouping okay but
[02:33:32 -> 02:33:40]  where is the baby and he starts looking okay but everyone
[02:33:40 -> 02:33:51]  sat around the baby has to be here somewhere well not right now but when we find the baby
[02:33:51 -> 02:34:29]  there will be a baby you know i'm starting to think i shouldn't trust city folks anymore
[02:34:40 -> 02:35:41]  this would never happen in my village i didn't have a squibble yes they're just like but she had a
[02:35:41 -> 02:35:41]  baby
[02:36:14 -> 02:38:07]  well you would know something about burying bodies it's not yasir they're saying that
[02:38:57 -> 02:38:58]  oh my god
[02:41:12 -> 02:41:13]  oh
[02:41:13 -> 02:48:22]  okay oh my god oh
[02:48:24 -> 02:48:26]  does that pay the against on the one you check out or
[02:49:03 -> 02:49:08]  yasir goes at next during the body because he doesn't believe nixon the upper body's trying to
[02:49:08 -> 02:49:10]  actually they go crazy
[02:49:14 -> 02:49:57]  or Michelle
[02:49:57 -> 02:51:36]  what do you think we're doing out there
[02:51:36 -> 02:51:45]  we don't know the woman's name
[02:51:45 -> 02:51:52]  a body
[02:51:52 -> 02:51:54]  yeah
[02:51:54 -> 02:51:58]  that's true
[02:51:58 -> 02:52:00]  that's true
[02:52:00 -> 02:52:02]  it was like a guilty conscience
[02:52:02 -> 02:52:03]  I don't know
[02:52:03 -> 02:52:37]  did you take nerve
[02:52:37 -> 02:52:42]  I hate bad things
[02:52:42 -> 02:52:48]  it's so funny
[02:52:48 -> 02:53:11]  oh my god
[02:53:11 -> 02:53:36]  yeah pretty much
[02:53:36 -> 02:59:27]  except for Baradun

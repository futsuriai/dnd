[00:00:01 -> 00:03:02]  now recording it's okay wait is it evening i thought like when we have left early okay
[00:03:02 -> 00:15:50]  okay surely if you do like a you go in oh wait outside whitaker whitman obviously what's his
[00:15:50 -> 00:22:37]  color whoa is that his color or is that because he's at the head of the family what are the rate
[00:22:37 -> 00:22:41]  what are the rates what are the rates because down the street offered me two percent
[00:22:41 -> 00:29:43]  oh my god bobby's bobby's furiously like researching like medieval punishment for
[00:29:43 -> 00:36:20]  fraud and lara just asked why do we even need money aren't we just on the road for the next
[00:36:20 -> 00:36:53]  weeks and they're just kind of like tilts her head because i i suppose i thought we would just
[00:36:53 -> 00:36:54]  live off the land
[00:36:54 -> 00:42:46]  like anyone does when they're traveling he's the uh what's he what is he the the dean dean
[00:42:46 -> 00:42:55]  is that yeah like he's the dean of the seminary he's one of the most respected eulogians in the
[00:42:55 -> 00:43:06]  city well he has been quite trustworthy and has helped us so many times already and is looking
[00:43:06 -> 00:43:11]  into it at the looking into the situation at the highest levels of government he just takes time
[00:43:12 -> 00:43:34]  he just grabs your
[00:43:34 -> 00:43:46]  hand and moves it out away and now she just like grabs it more forcefully and
[00:43:46 -> 00:45:29]  lambs it away he just kind of goes i know that you have asked me to question her multiple times but
[00:45:29 -> 00:45:35]  it is it is not good to lie master burden you're telling me that you snuck up to the
[00:45:35 -> 00:45:41]  four most powerful people in the party and they did not notice you that seems you know quite
[00:45:57 -> 00:46:25]  i know i have cried i know i have cried wolf many a time but what
[00:46:25 -> 00:47:02]  she just kind of nods at you very like yeah oh he did he just kind of laughs a little
[00:47:02 -> 00:47:18]  i'm sure thank thank you so much for telling me about this i understand you want to make me wary
[00:47:18 -> 00:47:25]  but next time maybe try something more believable but i i am careful i'm not going to lie to you
[00:47:25 -> 00:47:34]  don't worry but come on master baradun you have you have done many more believable things than
[00:47:34 -> 00:48:02]  this perhaps if you um did not lie so much i would be more likely to believe you switches
[00:48:02 -> 00:49:56]  sides to the other side of the carriage yeah no no you weren't there yeah you were you were out
[00:49:56 -> 00:50:05]  she she just kind of nods and says i do hope you were being honest when you said you are reflecting
[00:50:05 -> 00:50:05]  about
[00:50:05 -> 00:50:16]  the way you act but i suppose that was a okay impression of him i i don't really understand
[00:50:16 -> 00:50:39]  what you were trying to do but who knows she's just kind of like i i think the one that needs
[00:50:39 -> 00:50:46]  to be careful is you one of these days your lies will catch up to you and you know just kind of
[00:50:46 -> 00:51:02]  nods is that the estate or what
[00:51:02 -> 00:52:29]  oh well she maybe she's during the road she'll be reading the book that the guy gave her um but
[00:52:29 -> 00:56:21]  quietly oh lara last and lara's gonna ask oh do you need some food we have some some extra rations
[00:56:21 -> 00:56:40]  and how long have you been traveling and lara will just say well you would not be imposing
[00:56:40 -> 00:56:51]  it is the duty of those in the light to provide for those that seek it and she just kind of grabs
[00:56:51 -> 00:59:00]  some extra food or whatever you know lr is just gonna ask can you can you let us know who this man
[00:59:00 -> 01:02:09]  was i i wish to report him once we return to the city no no no no i don't think so i think she's
[01:02:09 -> 01:06:06]  just a nice normal person exactly lara lara would not yeah i'm an artificer of the highest
[01:06:06 -> 01:06:53]  renown i created a fake body immediately before you're killing blow i think lara would have been
[01:06:53 -> 01:06:54]  on the other side
[01:06:54 -> 01:07:16]  because she wants to make sure she's not crowded by all these men no no no no no i'm next to her
[01:07:16 -> 01:07:21]  like isadora's like i'm saying like she would have been next so that there's not like all these guys
[01:07:21 -> 01:12:53]  crowding this poor lady yeah i have advantage on wisdom saving throws because of my race
[01:12:53 -> 01:16:45]  which is a modified human thing no no but that's ability checks i think it's rare for them to need
[01:16:45 -> 01:16:49]  an ability check mid-fight right like they're not doing like a performance mid-fight or something
[01:16:49 -> 01:17:04]  all right or is ability
[01:17:04 -> 01:17:21]  something else uh how often do they do ability checks i guess if a save is an ability that's
[01:17:21 -> 01:17:56]  insane so like when you do like do a raw intelligence check that kind of thing that's
[01:17:56 -> 01:18:01]  insane how do you my mind is broken it seems insane you can't save
[01:18:01 -> 01:18:17]  huh okay that's that's a busted ass skill
[01:18:17 -> 01:23:41]  you're on fire you you strike through the fire so your limiter lights up so i'm next to him so
[01:23:41 -> 01:24:30]  disadvantage right for rain like a spell would be ranged though oh um wait what is this and a failed
[01:24:30 -> 01:24:50]  save and on yeah yeah yeah or guiding bolt or something okay so then i will
[01:24:50 -> 01:25:05]  just here's the size how do i draw the circles here it's five foot if it says area five feet
[01:25:05 -> 01:25:26]  that's the diameter or the radius a moon beam okay it didn't finish me okay so she'll just
[01:25:26 -> 01:26:03]  drop a moon beam here uh constitution yes so 2d 10 2d 10 uh i guess i could i should roll that
[01:26:04 -> 01:26:16]  yeah nine nine and just in case they were polymorphed or something they lose that but
[01:26:16 -> 01:26:47]  i don't think that matters um yeah bonus action no i don't have anything to do with for bonus action
[01:26:47 -> 01:33:11]  no because i'll trigger an attack good wait no no no no like he has two he has two divine smites
[01:33:11 -> 01:35:02]  oh you do no no
[01:35:03 -> 01:40:10]  is she a woman check no no yeah well i am down you probably should have used hunter's mark as a
[01:40:10 -> 01:43:07]  bonus action yes yeah and there's some advantage stuff but like if they try to hide that one's
[01:43:07 -> 01:45:39]  yeah wait does it show you as me having 30 for 24 it shows 13 for me that's weird
[01:45:39 -> 01:45:41]  yeah it shows me that's weird
[01:45:41 -> 01:46:34]  um i'm trying to think i might have to go help bring in some groceries soon but i will
[01:46:35 -> 01:46:41]  do my turn first um i just just have 13 hp but she does insane amounts of damage
[01:46:44 -> 01:47:10]  so i can't move unless it's with disadvantage yeah she's just gonna
[01:47:10 -> 01:47:11]  i'm just gonna
[01:47:11 -> 01:47:11]  i'm just gonna
[01:47:11 -> 01:47:16]  i'm just gonna
[01:47:16 -> 01:47:25]  wait spell i can't do a spell as a bonus action if i do a spell as a non-bonus action
[01:47:25 -> 01:47:46]  yeah what about spells that are not slotted but are due to a feature like star map lets me cast
[01:47:46 -> 01:48:02]  guiding bolt as an example three times per long rest yeah like star map lets me cast
[01:48:02 -> 01:48:10]  guiding bolt three three times per long rest without expending a spell slot okay okay okay
[01:48:10 -> 01:48:40]  that's what you meant all right um yeah she's just going to disengage then yeah um and then
[01:48:40 -> 01:48:50]  for bonus action i can just do healing spirit i guess
[01:48:50 -> 01:48:53]  five foot cube
[01:48:54 -> 01:49:03]  anything that enters or ends their turn restores can heal a number of one plus minimum of twice
[01:49:03 -> 01:49:13]  my spell casting modifier is plus three right yeah so four total times okay so i'm just gonna do that
[01:49:13 -> 01:49:31]  cast it for five foot square five foot square this and then heal myself with it
[01:49:34 -> 01:49:37]  spell spell spell spell healing spirit
[01:49:40 -> 01:56:16]  feels three i go wait at the door but i can listen for wait why did oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
[01:58:39 -> 01:59:33]  are you using your other thing no casting it as a bonus oh yeah what's the what do i need to roll
[02:00:00 -> 02:00:08]  i did not that's unfortunate
[02:00:08 -> 02:04:37]  what about the the other one the the no the dreadful strike what you have twice i think
[02:04:38 -> 02:04:52]  i think you aren't anymore you said it was one turn or was it forever okay so then yes um she
[02:04:57 -> 02:05:13]  and hopefully you have solutions for that she will i guess heal herself probably
[02:05:13 -> 02:05:16]  It's a touch spell, so I don't think there's any disadvantages.
[02:05:22 -> 02:05:28]  Heal for 10, and I'll move right here.
[02:05:35 -> 02:05:40]  Presumably now the bandit can't see me at all, right?
[02:05:45 -> 02:05:49]  Sure, but they wouldn't know where I am, in theory.
[02:05:59 -> 02:06:03]  Okay. I mean, sure, I'll just stay where I am.
[02:06:07 -> 02:06:10]  Yeah, that's fair. I'm good.
[02:06:11 -> 02:08:20]  I knew all my geometry studies would pay off.
[02:08:53 -> 02:08:56]  No. Unfortunately.
[02:09:01 -> 02:09:04]  This one is, if it hits, then it's really annoying,
[02:09:04 -> 02:09:06]  because they have to waste an action to get it off.
[02:09:11 -> 02:09:13]  Oh, I've been there. I've been there.
[02:11:27 -> 02:11:33]  Don't like this. Oh god.
[02:14:09 -> 02:16:38]  Mamma mia. Wait, did I not go?
[02:16:39 -> 02:16:40]  Hold on.
[02:16:53 -> 02:16:59]  Yeah. No, I didn't go last round.
[02:16:59 -> 02:17:01]  Oh, I did heal. Sorry, I didn't write it down.
[02:17:01 -> 02:17:02]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry.
[02:17:21 -> 02:17:58]  So, that is...
[02:17:59 -> 02:17:59]  Hmm?
[02:18:06 -> 02:18:07]  Do Guiding Bolt.
[02:18:08 -> 02:18:10]  Let's attack roll. Oh my god.
[02:18:11 -> 02:18:12]  13.
[02:18:15 -> 02:18:19]  And...
[02:18:23 -> 02:18:26]  Yeah, that's it. I'll just move a little further here.
[02:18:26 -> 02:18:26]  Oops.
[02:20:50 -> 02:20:50]  Yeah.
[02:20:50 -> 02:21:18]  Yeah, I mean, it also looks like you can infuse items and use Artificer infusions,
[02:21:18 -> 02:21:21]  but those probably need to be prepped in advance.
[02:21:21 -> 02:25:22]  Wait, so what is that? What did you put?
[02:25:24 -> 02:26:01]  Oh. Okay. No, not this time, unfortunately.
[02:30:29 -> 02:30:39]  Ah. Yeah. That's literally...
[02:31:02 -> 02:31:06]  Yeah, I snapped her in the eye, hung off her non-lethally.
[02:37:02 -> 02:37:04]  You can tell she's on the verge of tears, and she just...
[02:37:04 -> 02:37:09]  She just kind of goes and, like, kind of, almost like fetal position next to the fire.
[02:37:59 -> 02:38:01]  You hear a small thank you.
[02:38:19 -> 02:38:20]  Why did I say that?
[02:38:33 -> 02:38:34]  It was Cthulhu's one.
[02:40:01 -> 02:40:02]  Did I sleep?
[02:48:05 -> 02:48:07]  Did the body produce gold?
[02:48:07 -> 02:48:10]  When the body disappeared, as dead bodies do,
[02:49:27 -> 02:49:43]  if the truth is accurate, I'll get back to you.
[02:49:43 -> 02:49:45]  Because last time we thought it was just the robots,
[02:49:45 -> 02:49:47]  because there wasn't a human involved.
[02:49:52 -> 02:49:55]  Oh, yeah. Probably never seen someone get killed.
[02:49:55 -> 02:49:55]  I don't think so.
[02:49:57 -> 02:49:59]  Definitely seen people die, but not get killed.
[02:50:48 -> 02:50:53]  She wakes up very early and goes to do a prayer over the body.
[02:50:53 -> 02:50:54]  Like, at dawn.
[02:51:00 -> 02:51:01]  I assume she saw where...
[02:51:02 -> 02:51:04]  Oh, okay. Well, then I asked.
[02:51:04 -> 02:51:04]  Yeah.
[02:51:04 -> 02:51:53]  Here lies the bandit.
[02:52:07 -> 02:52:10]  She does the prayer, and then she just tells Nyx,
[02:52:10 -> 02:52:10]  Thank you for coming.
[02:52:11 -> 02:52:15]  I know that it probably had to be done, but I had...
[02:52:17 -> 02:52:18]  And then she just trails off.
[02:52:59 -> 02:53:01]  Ellara smiles slightly.
[02:53:01 -> 02:53:02]  Just doesn't say anything.
[02:53:30 -> 02:53:35]  No, I'm an assassin, but my heart is not complete garbage.
[02:53:35 -> 02:53:35]  That's...
[02:56:06 -> 02:56:06]  Yeah.
[02:56:11 -> 02:56:13]  Yeah, I think that's probably the easiest.
[02:56:13 -> 02:56:13]  Yeah.
[02:57:46 -> 02:57:47]  She's reading her book.
[02:57:47 -> 02:57:50]  She's just reading her book very intently.

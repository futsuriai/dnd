GM: One of the last scenes was Nyx\n[00:01:42] GM: kind of looking at his normal cat,\n[00:01:45] GM: where, you know, jobs are posted\n[00:01:47] GM: for those who work in Nyx's business.\n[00:01:49] GM: And it looks like a familiar figure\n[00:01:52] GM: that often posts these very valuable jobs\n[00:01:58] GM: called the Black Swan posted a hit job for Meri.\n[00:02:12] GM: That's kind of where we end it.\n[00:02:12] Nyx: we but did we end on me like did i tell the group i i feel like i remember having told the party\n[00:02:21] Nyx: about this board that's right i was looking at it and i'm

Whitaker\n[00:02:33] Ellara: and we're gonna lead him home.\n[00:02:35] GM: Oh, yes, that's what it was.\n[00:02:38] GM: Whitaker was lost because Whitaker has no sense of direction.\n[00:02:40] Ellara: Sorry, I forgot to post my summary.\n[00:02:41] Ellara: I'm gonna do that.\n[00:02:42] Ellara: Actually, do have it ready.\n[00:02:46] GM: I know, even I, I've been a little bit

GM: And I'm like...\n[00:02:58] GM: And then, because I just need things\n[00:03:01] GM: to, like, trigger my memory.\n[00:03:02] Ellara: I don't think so.\n[00:03:03] GM: And then once it's triggered, I'm like,\n[00:03:05] GM: oh, yeah, this, this, this, that, that.\n[00:03:12] Nyx: interact and be a part of it at the same time i do one thing or the other and so it's yeah i

\"Witty\" Whitman VI: i just like i'm gonna just walk straight to the bathroom and as i'm doing that i'm just like taking\n[00:05:28] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: off my clothes and just dropping them where they lie and by the end i'm just like walking by the\n[00:05:33] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: rest of the guys completely naked um except for i grab a purple hair net like a hair shower\n[00:05:40] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: um cap and put that on and grab a loofah and then head into the bathroom absolutely\n[00:05:54] Nyx: i just kind of look at the group and i'm just like kind of roll my eyes um\n[00:05:54] Ysidor: I'm studying Berridin.\n[00:05:56] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: make yourself at home and then you hear me\n[00:06:02] Nyx: um sit i just sit down and i'm just like so i think he's gonna\n[00:06:09] Nyx: take a bath and i just kind of yell at uh at Whitaker and i say hey can we just grab whatever\n[00:06:21] Nyx: like all right cool thank you no just just you know get comfortable and just we'll just\n[00:06:26] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: start like singing so at this point uh i open up the bathroom door covered in suds and just\n[00:06:27] Ysidor: Stealing things.\n[00:06:29] Ysidor: I'm seeing Berridin starting to pocket the silver.\n[00:06:32] GM: Oh!\n[00:06:33] Ysidor: The paintings, like how much is this worth?\n[00:06:40] Nyx: so um yeah okay so what i do is that then i say okay hey guys so all right so i found\n[00:06:53] Nyx: on a one of the usual board bulletin boards where i get contracts bounty hunters like such as\n[00:07:02] Nyx: myself we get balance we get contracts um and there was a contract up by someone named the\n[00:07:09] Nyx: black swan just long story short this is a patron who patron you know a job provider we don't know\n[00:07:19] Nyx: who they are they we've never no one knows who they are i haven't heard from them for a long time\n[00:07:20] Nyx: um they've never known this is a patron who i don't know who they are which is what i wanted to say\n[00:07:20] Nyx: um i think there's a lot to do with it it's two in general so i think one is black swan this one\n[00:07:20] Nyx: is black swan which means black swan new white swan and i think black swan is the black swan\n[00:07:20] Nyx: brother just something you've just been dropped it's seven feet in any do we can kind of\n[00:07:21] Nyx: know what black swan is black swan is black service private or does black swan work in the i ah i think\n[00:07:21] Nyx: I don't think anyone's ever seen them, but they are a very reliable source of difficult, high-risk, high-reward contracts.\n[00:07:35] Nyx: It's a big deal when one shows up from the black swan on a bulletin.\n[00:07:40] Nyx: And lo and behold, we have a bulletin.\n[00:07:43] Nyx: I saw a bulletin for Meri.\n[00:07:47] Nyx: Somebody put a hit out on Meri.\n[00:07:50] Nyx: Bobby, was it a hit or was it capture?\n[00:07:56] GM: This was an elimination.\n[00:07:57] GM: This was, like, the problem.\n[00:07:58] Nyx: Assassination.\n[00:07:59] GM: Yeah, it's written.\n[00:07:59] Nyx: Okay.\n[00:08:02] GM: I'll say it's written.\n[00:08:03] GM: It's never in such a way.\n[00:08:04] GM: It's removed the obstacle.\n[00:08:04] Nyx: Right.\n[00:08:06] Nyx: Right, right.\n[00:08:07] GM: And you can take it how you want.\n[00:08:08] Nyx: Right.\n[00:08:09] Nyx: Neutralize the threat.\n[00:08:11] GM: Yeah.\n[00:08:11] Nyx: Remove the obstacle.\n[00:08:12] GM: It's not, it's not, like...\n[00:08:13] Nyx: Yeah.\n[00:08:15] GM: If someone wants to do something else\n[00:08:17] GM: with Meri after, as long as Meri doesn't\n[00:08:19] GM: come back and be a problem...\n[00:08:21] Nyx: Right.\n[00:08:22] GM: Good.\n[00:08:22] Nyx: Okay, that's great.\n[00:08:24] Nyx: So I will say that.\n[00:08:25] Nyx: I'll say, you know, the wording was interesting.\n[00:08:29] Nyx: Certain people would read it as assassination.\n[00:08:33] Nyx: Kill them.\n[00:08:33] Nyx: Kill them.\n[00:08:34] Nyx: Kill them.\n[00:08:34] Nyx: But it was vague.\n[00:08:35] Nyx: Vague enough that it was just as long.\n[00:08:37] Nyx: It seems like as long as the problem is removed, we're fine.\n[00:08:44] Nyx: So I say we take the contract.\n[00:08:48] Nyx: I mean, the good news is there's nothing to do.\n[00:08:50] Nyx: Just complete the job first.\n[00:08:53] Nyx: So time is of the essence.\n[00:08:55] Nyx: Other people will have seen this bulletin.\n[00:08:57] Nyx: It is not secret.\n[00:09:01] Nyx: For people who know, they will see it.\n[00:09:05] Nyx: And it is a substantial sum.\n[00:09:08] Nyx: I forget what the Bobby.\n[00:09:10] Nyx: I forget what the how much they were offering to 50.\n[00:09:11] GM: It was...\n[00:09:11] Ellara: 250.\n[00:09:14] GM: Yeah.\n[00:09:14] Ellara: I just posted the notes.\n[00:09:14] Nyx: Okay.\n[00:09:16] GM: Oh.\n[00:09:16] Nyx: Okay.\n[00:09:16] Nyx: Got it.\n[00:09:17] GM: Okay.\n[00:09:17] Nyx: So, yeah, it was 250 gold.\n[00:09:19] Nyx: So definitely worth it.\n[00:09:21] Nyx: I think we can do we can kill two birds with one stone.\n[00:09:23] Nyx: We can't with this.\n[00:09:24] Nyx: We take the contract.\n[00:09:25] Nyx: We get Meri and we rescue her.\n[00:09:27] Nyx: Help her.\n[00:09:28] Nyx: I mean, rescue loosely.\n[00:09:30] Nyx: She can handle herself, but we help her.\n[00:09:33] Nyx: Yeah.\n[00:09:35] Nyx: And then we collect the money because, you know, now the only issue is what is a threat?\n[00:09:45] Nyx: Like, what is the problem?\n[00:09:46] Nyx: Because we find her.\n[00:09:51] Nyx: Anyway, that's a we can cross that bridge when we get there.\n[00:09:55] Nyx: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n[00:09:56] GM: And, like, here's what I've...\n[00:09:58] GM: What I will let you\n[00:10:00] GM: know is that, like,\n[00:10:04] GM: not, like...\n[00:10:05] GM: Meri needs to disappear.\n[00:10:07] GM: That's the end result.\n[00:10:08] GM: Whether she's dead, whether she's in prison,\n[00:10:10] Nyx: Exactly.\n[00:10:10] Nyx: No, that I got right.\n[00:10:11] GM: whether she's a scientific\n[00:10:13] GM: experiment...\n[00:10:14] GM: Um...\n[00:10:15] Nyx: She want they want her to.\n[00:10:17] Nyx: I'll say that.\n[00:10:17] Nyx: I'll say to the girl.\n[00:10:18] Nyx: I go.\n[00:10:19] Nyx: OK, they just want her to disappear so we can literally get her to safety.\n[00:10:24] Nyx: And just as long as she doesn't show up again.\n[00:10:29] Nyx: We're good and we get the money.\n[00:10:32] Nyx: So I think this is it's going to be really hard, but it is convenient.\n[00:10:39] Ellara: Are you saying this\n[00:10:39] Nyx: What do you say?\n[00:10:41] Ellara: to the house?\n[00:10:43] Ellara: Or did you call...\n[00:10:43] Nyx: I'm saying this to the.\n[00:10:44] Nyx: Yeah.\n[00:10:45] Ellara: Lupin, did you call in\n[00:10:45] Nyx: Oh, you know what?\n[00:10:47] Ellara: to the radio show?\n[00:10:50] GM: Yeah.\n[00:10:50] Ellara: Like, are you using the sending zone?\n[00:10:51] GM: Are you sorry with Ellara?\n[00:10:51] Ysidor: We confirmed the cell coverage.\n[00:10:54] Nyx: Is it OK if I retcon Ellara like I call?\n[00:10:57] GM: Yeah, that's fine.\n[00:10:58] Nyx: I should have done that.\n[00:10:58] Nyx: I call call Ellara.\n[00:11:00] Nyx: I say, Ellara, we're all here at.\n[00:11:02] Nyx: Has Ellara met with?\n[00:11:03] Nyx: Yes, of course.\n[00:11:04] GM: Yes.\n[00:11:05] Ellara: Unfortunately.\n[00:11:05] Nyx: You met at the party.\n[00:11:06] Ellara: Unfortunately.\n[00:11:06] Nyx: Yeah.\n[00:11:07] GM: I actually forgot about that,\n[00:11:07] Nyx: And yeah.\n[00:11:08] Nyx: And so I explain that I say what I just said.\n[00:11:12] Berridin: Okay.\n[00:11:13] Nyx: And I say the group and Ellara, I say, you know, so what do you all think?\n[00:11:19] Berridin: Do we have...\n[00:11:21] Berridin: Meri has one of our\n[00:11:23] Berridin: sending stones, right? Can we call her up?\n[00:11:27] Ellara: Lars, you can't see this,\n[00:11:29] Ellara: but I'm raising my hand.\n[00:11:33] Ellara: We both met the same Meri, right?\n[00:11:36] Ellara: She's not gonna stop\n[00:11:38] Ellara: fighting for her people.\n[00:11:41] Berridin: Yeah, I think we should\n[00:11:42] Berridin: probably just let her know\n[00:11:44] Berridin: what's happening.\n[00:11:45] Berridin: Either way.\n[00:11:47] Nyx: Yeah.\n[00:11:50] Berridin: Yeah.\n[00:11:52] Ysidor: You said it would cover.\n[00:11:54] Ysidor: I just want to put that out.\n[00:11:57] GM: but, like...\n[00:11:57] GM: Like, you know...\n[00:11:58] GM: I mean, it does not mess with\n[00:12:00] Ysidor: We had confirmed before.\n[00:12:03] Berridin: I take out my\n[00:12:05] GM: anything I plant, but...\n[00:12:08] GM: It gives a\n[00:12:09] GM: tactical advantage, I guess, to y'all.\n[00:12:13] Ysidor: Yeah.\n[00:12:13] Ysidor: How does this work?\n[00:12:14] Berridin: sending stone\n[00:12:16] Berridin: and I toss it to Ysidor\n[00:12:18] Berridin: because he's the one that doesn't have one, right?\n[00:12:20] GM: Yeah.\n[00:12:21] Berridin: Okay.\n[00:12:21] Nyx: Yeah.\n[00:12:22] GM: He gave his to Meri.\n[00:12:23] Berridin: Do you want to give her a...\n[00:12:24] Berridin: I make a motion, like, do you want to give her\n[00:12:24] Nyx: Yep.\n[00:12:26] Berridin: a call?\n[00:12:28] Nyx: Yeah.\n[00:12:31] Nyx: God damn it.\n[00:12:33] Berridin: I think you just yell at it.\n[00:12:34] Ysidor: I both say in-character and out-of-character.\n[00:12:37] Nyx: Yeah.\n[00:12:38] Nyx: Yeah.\n[00:12:38] Nyx: Yeah.\n[00:12:38] Ysidor: It's intense.\n[00:12:41] Nyx: Yeah.\n[00:12:41] Nyx: Yeah.\n[00:12:41] Nyx: Yeah.\n[00:12:41] Nyx: Yeah.\n[00:12:42] Nyx: One button.\n[00:12:43] Berridin: Okay.\n[00:12:43] Ellara: It's intent.\n[00:12:45] Berridin: Intent. Yeah.\n[00:12:46] Ellara: The power of names.\n[00:12:46] Ysidor: So I just\n[00:12:47] Ysidor: grab the\n[00:12:49] Ysidor: holds of stone like this\n[00:12:51] Ysidor: and it's like screams\n[00:12:53] Ysidor: like full-blown like\n[00:12:55] Ysidor: Meri?\n[00:12:58] Berridin: Ysidor, you also have to\n[00:12:58] Ysidor: And it waits for a response.\n[00:12:59] Berridin: you also have to make a\n[00:13:01] Berridin: you have to make a sound, like a\n[00:13:03] Berridin: like a ringing sound, and then it will work.\n[00:13:06] Nyx: God damn it.\n[00:13:09] Ysidor: Meri?\n[00:13:09] Ysidor: Ding.\n[00:13:11] Ysidor: Ring.\n[00:13:12] Ysidor: Ring me!\n[00:13:13] GM: And you hear, like...\n[00:13:16] GM: For a moment,\n[00:13:17] GM: you start hearing a bit of fumbling, like,\n[00:13:19] GM: like, what, what, what?\n[00:13:20] GM: Little Hill? Ring? Ring?

Berridin: Yeah.\n[00:13:33] Ysidor: I actually would call her that.\n[00:13:35] Ysidor: Never mind.\n[00:13:35] Ysidor: Meri!\n[00:13:38] Ysidor: It's me.\n[00:13:39] Ysidor: It's Ysidor.\n[00:13:41] GM: Little Hill?\n[00:13:42] GM: Like, the stone you gave me\n[00:13:45] GM: started making noise.\n[00:13:46] GM: I guess this is how it's supposed to work.\n[00:13:50] Ysidor: I don't know.\n[00:13:51] Ysidor: The city folk have weird magic, but\n[00:13:54] Ysidor: you're inside this little stone\n[00:13:57] Ysidor: and I have to give you a message.\n[00:13:59] Ysidor: The stone's much bigger than I expected.\n[00:14:01] GM: Well, I don't feel like\n[00:14:02] GM: I'm in the village.\n[00:14:04] GM: I mean, here's, uh...\n[00:14:09] Ysidor: They have a full...\n[00:14:10] Nyx: Right.\n[00:14:10] Ysidor: It's a small village inside.\n[00:14:12] GM: We usually don't get swans up here,\n[00:14:20] Ysidor: Meri,\n[00:14:20] Ysidor: the...\n[00:14:22] Ysidor: We have news that...\n[00:14:23] Ysidor: Which organization?\n[00:14:26] Ysidor: Sorry, it's not the church.\n[00:14:28] Ellara: The Black Swan.\n[00:14:28] Ysidor: It's...\n[00:14:29] Nyx: Duskbreaker Lighthouse.\n[00:14:30] Nyx: Oh, yeah.\n[00:14:31] Nyx: Can I?\n[00:14:31] Ysidor: Black swans are coming to kill you.\n[00:14:35] Ysidor: I know.\n[00:14:40] GM: but they're fairly easy to get rid of.\n[00:14:43] Ysidor: I don't know why people are worried about it,\n[00:14:44] Nyx: Nyx walks over to.\n[00:14:45] Ysidor: but they seem to be in quite a quite an urgency.\n[00:14:47] Ysidor: Maybe these are special...\n[00:14:50] Ysidor: These are special city black swans.\n[00:14:54] Nyx: Nyx walks over and just tap Ysidor and just say, hey, may I explain the situation to\n[00:15:01] Nyx: Meri?\n[00:15:02] Ysidor: Okay.\n[00:15:03] Ysidor: Bye, Meri.\n[00:15:04] Ysidor: Bye, little Meri.\n[00:15:05] Nyx: OK.\n[00:15:05] Ysidor: I give the stone.\n[00:15:06] GM: Bye, Little Hill!\n[00:15:08] GM: Also, by the way,\n[00:15:08] Nyx: Oh, yeah.\n[00:15:08] Ysidor: Oh, 100% matters.\n[00:15:10] GM: I attacked, like, black swans.\n[00:15:11] GM: I picture just black Canadian geese.\n[00:15:14] GM: God.\n[00:15:15] Ellara: Yeah.\n[00:15:15] Nyx: 100 percent.\n[00:15:15] Ysidor: Yeah.\n[00:15:16] Ellara: Which, you know, would be worth warning about.\n[00:15:17] Nyx: oh man okay so i i go hello Meri yes yes speaking i figured that i would be able to give\n[00:15:19] GM: Yeah.\n[00:15:19] Ysidor: Honestly?\n[00:15:20] GM: Yeah.\n[00:15:20] Berridin: Intent.\n[00:15:22] Ysidor: I forgot.\n[00:15:27] GM: Um, you're...\n[00:15:29] GM: You're Nyx, right?\n[00:15:35] Nyx: a perhaps better overview of the situation um so i\n[00:15:43] GM: Well, this is not swans.\n[00:15:43] Nyx: yeah don't i i'll explain so quick background i'm a bounty hunter i can't remember i can't\n[00:15:52] Nyx: remember if i if she knows that about me but i just whatever um and i saw on a bulletin board\n[00:15:55] GM: I mean, that would make a lot more sense.\n[00:15:59] Nyx: where we get our jobs that someone named the black swan who is a person not an actual swan\n[00:16:06] Nyx: that is their uh yep exactly so he put\n[00:16:09] GM: Little...\n[00:16:09] GM: Little Hill.\n[00:16:11] GM: Sometimes a little too literal.\n[00:16:14] GM: Um...\n[00:16:15] Nyx: they\n[00:16:15] Nyx: they posted a board a job and not gonna mince words on this it was a very uh well-paid\n[00:16:26] Nyx: job to remove you by name Meri and then there's a little description of you\n[00:16:34] GM: That would probably explain\n[00:16:36] Nyx: now the good news is that it was removed which means whatever and\n[00:16:45] Nyx: i we wanted to make sure that you knew and discuss what we could do about this situation\n[00:16:53] Nyx: they're after you in short that is an issue honestly right honestly the at this point the\n[00:16:59] GM: all these men.\n[00:17:02] GM: Um...\n[00:17:02] GM: The sitting army not far away.\n[00:17:10] GM: They, uh...\n[00:17:11] GM: They've been encamped for a few days now,\n[00:17:14] GM: but they don't seem to be moving.\n[00:17:17] GM: Um, something, something,\n[00:17:18] GM: ducal decree, blah, blah, blah.\n[00:17:21] GM: Really didn't pay attention.\n[00:17:23] GM: Um, it's same shit, different pile.\n[00:17:25] GM: The same reason why I came back.\n[00:17:27] GM: Um, looks like\n[00:17:29] GM: this duke of yours,\n[00:17:31] GM: this grand duke of yours,\n[00:17:32] GM: is, uh, not taking no seriously\n[00:17:34] GM: and is, um, using some force.\n[00:17:37] GM: Um...\n[00:17:37] GM: They want access to the hills.\n[00:17:40] GM: To the mountains.\n[00:17:44] Nyx: black swan is probably the dude so um yeah so by the way like i think that can i put this on speaker\n[00:17:53] Nyx: i don't\n[00:17:55] Nyx: want it doesn't make sense if like if it's just am i talking directly to her\n[00:17:59] GM: Yeah, you can have it on speaker.\n[00:17:59] Nyx: can other people hear because like or else i have to repeat all of this oh okay that's true right\n[00:18:02] GM: Sure.\n[00:18:02] Berridin: Do we have...\n[00:18:03] GM: Sure.\n[00:18:04] Ellara: There's no...\n[00:18:05] Ellara: There's no, like...\n[00:18:06] Ellara: It's always on speaker, no?\n[00:18:08] GM: Yeah, kind of.\n[00:18:10] GM: They're not the...\n[00:18:11] GM: They're not really stealthy.\n[00:18:12] Ellara: They're not psychic.\n[00:18:14] GM: They're not stealthy.\n[00:18:14] Ellara: Like, it's obvious.\n[00:18:15] Nyx: right right right okay so what do you all think damn it i forgot about this\n[00:18:26] Berridin: I speak up.\n[00:18:31] Berridin: Hey, mommy.\n[00:18:32] Berridin: It's Berridin.\n[00:18:36] Berridin: How many people\n[00:18:37] Berridin: how many people are there?\n[00:18:39] Berridin: How many guys?\n[00:18:40] Berridin: How many men did you spot?\n[00:18:44] GM: They're not your mother,\n[00:18:45] GM: first of all, little one.\n[00:18:46] Nyx: i'm not okay on me\n[00:18:47] Berridin: Okay, mom.\n[00:18:48] GM: Um...\n[00:18:49] GM: Of course, you said, uh...\n[00:18:50] Nyx: i'm not okay on me\n[00:18:50] Nyx: i'm not okay on me\n[00:18:50] Ysidor: No, exactly.\n[00:18:57] GM: Of course Little Hill would make friends like this.\n[00:19:01] GM: Um...\n[00:19:01] GM: By my reckoning,\n[00:19:04] GM: maybe\n[00:19:05] GM: just a small force, about 20 soldiers,\n[00:19:08] GM: but they seem to be waiting for something.\n[00:19:10] GM: They haven't moved yet.\n[00:19:13] Ellara: How many soldiers?\n[00:19:13] Ellara: 40?\n[00:19:14] GM: 20.\n[00:19:18] Berridin: At their current strength levels, how much\n[00:19:21] Berridin: of a threat are they to you guys right now?\n[00:19:24] GM: Oh, they're...\n[00:19:25] GM: They're not doing anything.\n[00:19:26] GM: Um...\n[00:19:27] GM: So, not much of a threat.\n[00:19:30] GM: I could probably take out...\n[00:19:32] GM: We could probably take out most of them,\n[00:19:34] GM: but it wouldn't be a great strategy\n[00:19:36] GM: just coming with 20, knowing\n[00:19:38] GM: us, uh, Goliaths,\n[00:19:42] GM: are fairly hardy creatures.\n[00:19:44] GM: So...\n[00:19:46] GM: Something tells me\n[00:19:48] GM: there's more at foot here.\n[00:19:50] GM: Um, as a reminder,\n[00:19:52] Berridin: They could be gathering\n[00:19:53] Berridin: more forces.\n[00:19:55] Berridin: Definitely.\n[00:19:58] Nyx: i'm not okay on me\n[00:19:58] Nyx: i'm not okay on me\n[00:19:58] Nyx: oh yeah\n[00:20:00] Berridin: Well,\n[00:20:01] GM: um, there was conversation.\n[00:20:01] Berridin: yeah.\n[00:20:03] GM: Um...\n[00:20:03] GM: There was conversations about sending Warforged Constructs.\n[00:20:06] Ellara: Mm-hmm.\n[00:20:08] Berridin: Oh, yeah. I overheard that.\n[00:20:10] Nyx: oh yeah\n[00:20:10] Nyx: oh yeah right\n[00:20:11] GM: Yeah.\n[00:20:11] Nyx: right\n[00:20:11] Nyx: right yeah\n[00:20:12] Berridin: Okay.\n[00:20:14] Berridin: Yeah.\n[00:20:15] Berridin: You've been a real thorn in\n[00:20:17] Berridin: their story.\n[00:20:19] Berridin: You're a real thorn in their story.\n[00:20:20] Berridin: I think they're gonna send\n[00:20:26] Berridin: even more powerful\n[00:20:27] Berridin: reinforcements your way.\n[00:20:30] Berridin: Is that something that would overwhelm you guys?\n[00:20:33] GM: Um...\n[00:20:34] GM: Depending on what you mean?\n[00:20:36] GM: Yes.\n[00:20:37] GM: Um...\n[00:20:38] GM: We're just a small village on the foot of the hills.\n[00:20:40] GM: Really...\n[00:20:42] GM: I don't, um...\n[00:20:44] GM: There's only so...\n[00:20:45] GM: Not all...\n[00:20:46] GM: While all our people are fairly strong,\n[00:20:49] GM: um, not all of them are fully trained.\n[00:20:51] GM: We're not fighters.\n[00:20:53] GM: It would take you a few weeks.\n[00:20:57] Berridin: Okay.\n[00:20:58] Berridin: How long would it take\n[00:21:01] Berridin: our little small party\n[00:21:02] Berridin: to reach you guys?\n[00:21:04] Berridin: A few weeks.\n[00:21:09] Berridin: Okay. That seems like a problem.\n[00:21:10] GM: I think...\n[00:21:11] GM: I think our lore was, like,\n[00:21:13] GM: three weeks or something.\n[00:21:15] Ellara: Yeah, it was like around a month.\n[00:21:16] GM: Yeah.\n[00:21:16] Ellara: Something like that.\n[00:21:17] GM: Yeah, something like...\n[00:21:17] Ellara: Depending on how fast you go.\n[00:21:18] GM: Yeah.\n[00:21:19] GM: ...\n[00:21:27] Nyx: yeah\n[00:21:27] Nyx: yeah that's right\n[00:21:28] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: stick my head out and say hey has anybody seen my rubber ducky no okay can you throw it to me

Do an intelligence check.\n[00:22:47] GM: Because you all used it.\n[00:22:51] Berridin: Intelligence.\n[00:22:56] Berridin: Why do I have such bad intelligence?\n[00:22:59] Berridin: Oh, God.\n[00:23:00] GM: Yeah.\n[00:23:00] Ysidor: We all do.\n[00:23:01] Ellara: Yeah.\n[00:23:02] Ellara: You start drooling.\n[00:23:02] Nyx: stat for all of us\n[00:23:03] Nyx: you basically\n[00:23:04] GM: Except for Whitaker and a little bit for Ellara.\n[00:23:07] GM: Uh...\n[00:23:08] GM: Um...\n[00:23:09] GM: Uh...\n[00:23:10] GM: Uh...\n[00:23:10] Nyx: were like what are

mean?\n[00:23:20] Ysidor: A dirty...\n[00:23:20] Ysidor: Oh, it's like a...\n[00:23:21] Ellara: You start drooling.\n[00:23:21] Ysidor: We should go to her.\n[00:23:23] GM: Boo.\n[00:23:24] GM:

there in time with, uh, Warforged Constructs on their\n[00:23:32] GM: way.\n[00:23:34] Berridin: Yeah, it seems\n[00:23:35] Berridin: like we're going to have to\n[00:23:37] Berridin: use some sort of other\n[00:23:38] Berridin: mode of transportation.\n[00:23:41] Berridin: Anyone have any ideas?\n[00:23:45] Ellara: Ellara speaks up and says,\n[00:23:47] Ellara: wait, why do we need to go there?\n[00:23:50] Ellara: Why can't she just come here?\n[00:23:55] GM: I don't know.\n[00:23:56] GM: I mean...\n[00:24:03] Nyx: just like yeah I'll get you an uber\n[00:24:04] Nyx: okay\n[00:24:05] GM: Meri's just like,\n[00:24:08] GM: I'm not leaving with an army at the doorstep.\n[00:24:08] Berridin: We got to fight.\n[00:24:15] Nyx: look I'm willing to go\n[00:24:19] Ysidor: We should go to my village.\n[00:24:20] Berridin: Fight.\n[00:24:20] Ysidor: It's a great village.\n[00:24:25] Berridin: Yeah, let's go on a walking tour.\n[00:24:33] Berridin: Does anyone know\n[00:24:34] Berridin: of any\n[00:24:36] Berridin: teleportation\n[00:24:37] Berridin: capabilities?\n[00:24:39] Ysidor: Oh, my God.\n[00:24:40] Berridin: I don't think so.\n[00:24:45] Nyx: I want the 250 gold though\n[00:24:47] Nyx: so I need a reason\n[00:24:49] Nyx: because if I go\n[00:24:52] Nyx: I can't do any\n[00:24:53] Nyx: I'm not working for that amount of time\n[00:24:55] Berridin: But the 250 gold is\n[00:24:55] Ellara: Is there a check?\n[00:24:56] Berridin: to kill Meri.\n[00:24:56] Nyx: nice\n[00:24:57] Ellara: Is there a check I can do\n[00:24:59] Ellara: to see if I would remember hearing\n[00:25:01] Ellara: if any teleportation things even exist\n[00:25:03] Ellara: or have been rumored or spoken about?\n[00:25:07] GM: Um...\n[00:25:08] GM: Give me just an intelligence.\n[00:25:09] GM: Just intelligence.\n[00:25:11] GM: Come on.\n[00:25:12] GM: You have a plus one.\n[00:25:13] GM: Another two.\n[00:25:14] GM: Another two.\n[00:25:15] GM: Um...\n[00:25:15] Berridin: Oh, God.\n[00:25:16] GM: The idea of...\n[00:25:16] Ellara: Yeah.\n[00:25:17] GM: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n[00:25:17] Berridin: I really need\n[00:25:17] Ellara: If they exist.\n[00:25:18] GM: So, I would say, um...\n[00:25:19] GM: Ellara, like, you're also from a small town.\n[00:25:19] Nyx: well done\n[00:25:20] GM: Like, these toxic teleportation circles, you're like, what?\n[00:25:22] Nyx: oh no\n[00:25:23] GM: Like, you understand the concept, but that would, like...\n[00:25:24] GM: That kind of matches.\n[00:25:24] Berridin: Whitaker out here.\n[00:25:25] GM: They're like, what?\n[00:25:25] Berridin: This could derail\n[00:25:26] GM: Yeah.\n[00:25:27] GM: Yeah.\n[00:25:28] GM: Yeah.\n[00:25:29] GM: Yeah.\n[00:25:30] GM: Yeah.\n[00:25:31] GM: Yeah.\n[00:25:32] GM: Yeah.\n[00:25:33] GM: Yeah.\n[00:25:34] GM: Yeah.\n[00:25:35] GM: Yeah.\n[00:25:36] GM: Yeah.\n[00:25:37] GM: Yeah.\n[00:25:38] GM: Yeah.\n[00:25:39] GM: Yeah.\n[00:25:40] GM: Yeah.\n[00:25:41] GM: Yeah.\n[00:25:44] GM: Yeah.\n[00:25:45] GM: Yeah.\n[00:25:47] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: come out of the bathroom fully dressed all of a sudden um and uh i would probably yeah\n[00:25:53] GM: Yeah.\n[00:25:54] GM: Yeah.\n[00:25:55] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: not full not fully dressed just my under undergarments i guess um but then i i probably\n[00:25:55] Ysidor: Shocking.\n[00:26:03] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: know about any teleportation that exists yeah\n[00:26:08] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: i don't know i don't know i don't know i don't know i don't know i don't know i don't know i don't know\n[00:26:13] GM: Yeah.\n[00:26:14] GM: Yeah.\n[00:26:15] GM: Yeah.\n[00:26:15] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: um sorry intelligence is not on my list oh i see that's oh my god oh that's a seven i thought it\n[00:26:19] GM: Yeah.\n[00:26:21] Berridin: our entire campaign.\n[00:26:22] Berridin: Oh, it just click\n[00:26:26] Berridin: on the button\n[00:26:27] Berridin: at the top of your screen,\n[00:26:29] Berridin: like your actual ability.\n[00:26:31] GM: Yeah.\n[00:26:31] Berridin: I've tried to.\n[00:26:32] GM: Anyway.\n[00:26:33] GM: Um...\n[00:26:34] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: was a one okay like a bullet train no okay we're just we're just steampunk but there's no trains\n[00:26:36] GM: Oh, you dressed yourself!\n[00:26:37] GM: Ha!\n[00:26:38] GM: I would...\n[00:26:39] GM: Roll intelligence!\n[00:26:40] GM: Intelligence check.\n[00:26:41] GM: Yeah...\n[00:26:42] GM: Just the...\n[00:26:43] GM: Oh, yeah.\n[00:26:44] GM: No.\n[00:26:45] GM: A 10.\n[00:26:46] GM: A 10's enough.\n[00:26:47] GM: Um...\n[00:26:48] GM: You've been kind of idly paying attention, I would say, and what you were told, like,\n[00:26:54] GM: a lot longer than traditional methods so i would say that you would well any tel there wouldn't be\n[00:27:11] GM: any kind of teleportation technology whether or not that exists it would definitely not exist\n[00:27:17] GM: going to um but nowhere um but to and also if there was one to get there it would\n[00:27:29] GM: they would use it to get there so they would get there even faster but i will give you with a 10\n[00:27:38] GM: if uh what you've heard with Warforged Constructs this party could move a lot faster than\n[00:27:44] GM: any kind of moving army or carrying any heavy equipment including Warforged Constructs nope there's no train\n[00:28:02] GM: this is this is just oh this is the middle\n[00:28:02] Ellara: Not quite that steampunk.\n[00:28:05] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: oh that's right that's right hot air hot air balloon we will all die the announcement's over\n[00:28:06] Berridin: No trains.\n[00:28:07] Berridin: Okay, that's kind of hilarious.\n[00:28:08] GM: of nowhere this is this is this is a backwater imperial province to a hill to the nowhere that\n[00:28:10] Ellara: Okay, but, you know, in Japan,\n[00:28:12] Ellara: there's trains...\n[00:28:13] Ellara: I'm just picturing, like, everyone at Nyx's\n[00:28:21] GM: they're trying to find to a mountainside that they're trying to start digging doing mining\n[00:28:26] GM: projects i mean if you if you want to have have one um and then pilot it i will\n[00:28:44] GM: if you if you want to try to source one\n[00:28:49] Berridin: We have a gas alchemist.\n[00:28:50] GM: i\n[00:28:50] GM: i'll i'll let a fun air balloon enter the conversation but you have to source or make it\n[00:28:54] GM: and get your get there i mean if you want to do it like it's not i there will be like i'm not going\n[00:29:03] Berridin: And the idea of a balloon came up.\n[00:29:09] Berridin: I would like to explore this possibility.\n[00:29:15] Berridin: That's even a thing that could be our main\n[00:29:17] Berridin: mode of transportation.\n[00:29:19] Berridin: And then we'd have to force Bobby to\n[00:29:24] Berridin: constantly RP with a hot air balloon around.\n[00:29:27] Berridin: That's true.\n[00:29:35] GM: to say restrictions but it's not like you can fly all night or like you know for five days or without\n[00:29:43] GM: landing or anything right because you guys have to you know eat and stuff and get food there's\n[00:29:49] GM: there is a limit of weight\n[00:29:50] GM: and fuel it's fine\n[00:29:55] Berridin: Okay, so shall we start looking for I guess,\n[00:30:03] Berridin: basic transportation, maybe a carriage?\n[00:30:06] Berridin: Whitaker, do you have like, do you have a car?\n[00:30:12] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: i can talk again sorry of course my family my family has a carriage\n[00:30:19] Berridin: Do you have a carriage?\n[00:30:21] Berridin: Oh, okay.\n[00:30:25] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: i'm not sure i did at one point but um i haven't seen them since jarvis left\n[00:30:26] Berridin: That's not bad.\n[00:30:27] Berridin: Do we have?\n[00:30:28] Berridin: Do we have?\n[00:30:29] Berridin: Do you have horses?\n[00:30:36] Ysidor: Here's the idea of the horse.\n[00:30:41] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: so i could call in a favor to lady that i can't remember her name that i\n[00:30:43] Berridin: Okay, we need to get horses and then\n[00:30:46] Berridin: and then we should head out to Meri.\n[00:30:55] Ysidor: Do you know what this is?\n[00:31:04] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: have some fun with Lady Jacinta and see if she has any horses that we could\n[00:31:05] Berridin: Oh, yeah, that's hilarious.\n[00:31:09] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: uh all right so then i'm gonna uh are you all cool\n[00:31:10] Berridin: Well, I would recommend starting off\n[00:31:13] Berridin: seeing if she can help you procure a hot air balloon,\n[00:31:17] Berridin: because I'm not going to give up on that one.\n[00:31:19] Berridin: But definitely grab a horse if it's possible to.\n[00:31:22] Berridin: Oh, no, I think I think our Whitaker.\n[00:31:23] Berridin: Oh, no, I think our Whitaker.\n[00:31:29] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: hanging out here do we want to do you want do you want to all go together um as the\n[00:31:34] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: as the Whitaker brothers again um oh that's right that's right perfect uh oh and uh that'll\n[00:31:38] Berridin: Oh, no, I think our Whitaker.\n[00:31:39] Berridin: Identity is compromised.\n[00:31:41] Nyx: yeah my Whitaker\n[00:31:42] Ysidor: It could compromise.\n[00:31:43] Nyx: identity is completely compromised\n[00:31:45] Nyx: I can't ever do that\n[00:31:47] Nyx: again\n[00:31:48] Nyx: what about the gas\n[00:31:52] Berridin: But I'll go with you.\n[00:31:53] Berridin: I'll go with you.\n[00:31:55] Berridin: I'll be a wingman.\n[00:32:02] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: give us a a great opportunity for us to have a discussion about your compensation uh just\n[00:32:07] Berridin: Yes. Yeah, I agree.\n[00:32:10] Berridin: And I find Berridin finds himself\n[00:32:14] Berridin: mindlessly picking up Whitaker's clothes that he's strewn about.\n[00:32:19] Berridin: And then he just looks at him like, what the hell am I doing?\n[00:32:19] Ysidor: Oh, my God.\n[00:32:20] Ysidor: Dude.\n[00:32:23] Berridin: And then he just looks at him like, what the hell am I doing?\n[00:32:25] Berridin: I just dump it all on him.\n[00:32:26] Berridin: I just dump it all on him.\n[00:32:27] Berridin: I just dump it all off.\n[00:32:28] Berridin: And then I quickly try to usher Whitaker outside the door, as we can see.\n[00:32:32] GM: Whitaker's still in his small clothes okay uh\n[00:32:33] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: so just so you know uh yeah and yeah just so you know i liked

a hot air balloon do they come in purple perfect i could walk up and uh grab her hand\n[00:34:20] GM: in fashion\n[00:34:23] GM: let's see\n[00:34:26] GM: I believe\n[00:34:29] GM: if you go\n[00:34:31] GM: to Dunstance\n[00:34:33] GM: and Kirk's they might be able to\n[00:34:35] GM: get you a hot air balloon\n[00:34:36] GM: they're not cheap\n[00:34:38] GM: they're all the vogue\n[00:34:41] GM: though right now I think they finally\n[00:34:43] GM: reached here\n[00:34:44] GM: much more popular\n[00:34:47] GM: elsewhere\n[00:34:47] GM: well they're all bespoke so\n[00:34:55] GM: I'm pretty sure as long as you're willing\n[00:34:57] GM: to pay up you will get whatever\n[00:34:59] GM: you want\n[00:35:00] GM: are the horses a balloon\n[00:35:06] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: and kind of like give it a little kiss on her hand and then ask her uh oh do you have\n[00:35:11] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: any horses too\n[00:35:18] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: we only need one then can walk no well i need to i need to get to the place right to to\n[00:35:19] GM: balloon\n[00:35:19] GM: wait are we are you putting the\n[00:35:26] GM: horses are the horses\n[00:35:28] GM: related to the hot air balloon\n[00:35:30] GM: oh Dunstance and Kirk\n[00:35:31] Berridin: No, the horses are.\n[00:35:34] Berridin: Oh, oh, OK.\n[00:35:36] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: get the hot air balloon i was just trying to expedite the travel to the we can make\n[00:35:40] GM: it's only a 10 minute stroll\n[00:35:43] GM: away I don't know if you\n[00:35:45] GM: you would need horses for that\n[00:35:47] GM: I mean\n[00:35:52] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: that work for for what\n[00:35:54] Berridin: Can I casually just point out to Whitaker?\n[00:35:56] Berridin: I was like, Whitaker, do you have money?\n[00:35:58] Berridin: Do you have money?\n[00:35:59] Berridin: Do you have money?\n[00:36:00] Berridin: Do you have enough money for the hot air balloon?\n[00:36:07] Berridin: You got to use money to pay for this thing.\n[00:36:11] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: Yeah, they can charge it to my family's account.\n[00:36:16] Berridin: You have an open tab with any merchant in the city?\n[00:36:20] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: It doesn't hurt to ask.\n[00:36:24] Berridin: No, no, no, no, no.\n[00:36:28] Berridin: Lady Jacinta.\n[00:36:29] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: How much money do I have?\n[00:36:31] Ysidor: It's probably not enough.\n[00:36:35] GM: Whitaker has said he hasn't checked his accounts\n[00:36:36] Berridin: I know, Whitaker has no understanding of money or currency.\n[00:36:38] GM: in a while\n[00:36:39] GM: well I would assume I am by\n[00:36:44] Berridin: Lady Jacinta, how much would a hot air balloon cost you, cost us?\n[00:36:45] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: None at all.\n[00:36:56] GM: no means no tinkerer\n[00:36:59] GM: merchant or anything\n[00:37:00] GM: but I would\n[00:37:03] GM: assume\n[00:37:04] GM: a cheap one\n[00:37:07] GM: 100 gold or so\n[00:37:09] GM: Nyx gets chills down his spine\n[00:37:10] Berridin: Oh, OK, yeah.\n[00:37:12] Berridin: Mix should definitely

OK.\n[00:37:32] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: Or for Din.\n[00:37:34] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: Have you not seen the suits he makes?\n[00:37:37] GM: gently put the hand on your arm\n[00:37:40] GM: and goes\n[00:37:41] GM: darling we did speak about this\n[00:37:44] GM: no\n[00:37:45] GM: servant is worth that much\n[00:37:48] GM: and din was it\n[00:37:50] GM: are you trying\n[00:37:52] GM: to rob this man blind\n[00:37:52] Berridin: At your service.\n[00:37:54] GM: with\n[00:37:57] Berridin: I charge by the services procured.\n[00:38:01] Berridin: And I'm one of the top services procured.\n[00:38:02] Berridin: I charge by the services procured.\n[00:38:03] Berridin: You sure?\n[00:38:09] GM: all due respect\n[00:38:09] Berridin: Yes.\n[00:38:10] GM: I've\n[00:38:11] GM: never heard of you and trust me\n[00:38:12] GM: if you're the top servant of the city I would hear heard of you\n[00:38:16] GM: yes but there's they all like to gossip and trust me\n[00:38:18] Berridin: I'm one of the top servants in the city.\n[00:38:19] Berridin: That's true.\n[00:38:21] Berridin: You know, among the top servants, discretion is one of our number one qualities.\n[00:38:25] GM: I would know\n[00:38:28] GM: are you\n[00:38:31] GM: Lord Whitaker I would be very careful of the company you are currently keeping as he seems to be quite the little swindler\n[00:38:41] GM: then you are a fool and a fool and his money will soon part\n[00:38:44] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: I trust Din with my life.\n[00:38:47] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: He's never let me down.\n[00:38:51] GM: well I will be on for my breakfast have a good day sir\n[00:38:54] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: I have plenty.\n[00:38:54] Ysidor: Damn.\n[00:39:04] GM: and her\n[00:39:05] GM: man serving kind of excurs you out at that point\n[00:39:08] GM: she's just like\n[00:39:09] Ysidor: Get out.\n[00:39:12] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: It was great seeing you again.\n[00:39:13] GM: surely\n[00:39:14] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: Call me.\n[00:39:17] GM: it'd be in your inventory tab\n[00:39:22] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: Din, so what do you mean?\n[00:39:23] Berridin: I don't think that went as well as you thought.\n[00:39:27] Berridin: How was last night with her?\n[00:39:32] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: Well, you know, I had a few hits of gas throughout the night.\n[00:39:39] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: And so it's a little blurry.\n[00:39:41] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: But I thought I went well.\n[00:39:42] Nyx: I forgot about the gas\n[00:39:46] Berridin: Limp.\n[00:39:47] Nyx: I forgot about that\n[00:39:48] Berridin: Limp gassistic, OK.\n[00:39:51] Nyx: my brain like blocked\n[00:39:53] Nyx: that whole sequence out\n[00:39:55] Nyx: wait\n[00:39:57] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: I wasn't the one that needed to be hard.\n[00:39:59] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: So it wasn't an issue.\n[00:40:04] Berridin: What?\n[00:40:05] Berridin: How much?\n[00:40:06] Berridin: How much gold do you have on you right now?\n[00:40:08] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: Where do I find them?\n[00:40:13] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: Do I know?\n[00:40:14] GM: where do you guys want to go\n[00:40:15] Berridin: Yeah.\n[00:40:16] Berridin: OK.\n[00:40:17] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: I have 25 gold.\n[00:40:18] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: I thought I gave you all my gold.\n[00:40:19] Berridin: Wow. Wow. I thought you were some, like, I thought you were some rich hotshot. What is this?\n[00:40:21] Ysidor: Definitely enough.\n[00:40:24] Nyx: he's got 25 gold\n[00:40:27] Nyx: yeah\n[00:40:30] Berridin: Yeah, but how are you going to keep paying me if you're only at 25 gold? Do you have more gold in your house?\n[00:40:30] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: So you have the gold.\n[00:40:32] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: And you're taking care of expenses.\n[00:40:38] Berridin: I can't take care of expenses if you don't have anything to give me. This isn't going to work.\n[00:40:38] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: We agreed that you were going to take care of expenses.\n[00:40:44] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: I gave you all my gold.\n[00:40:45] Berridin: Okay, I see. I thought, like, I thought I was going to attach myself to you and get rich quick, but it seems like I'm going to go back to my original benefactor, Nyx.\n[00:40:58] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: You're leaving me?\n[00:41:01] Berridin: I'm just taking a leave of absence, okay? Because I worry about your solvency here.\n[00:41:09] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: Can you still make me suits?\n[00:41:12] Berridin: Okay, we'll go on. We'll see, okay? And I kind of usher, can we head back to Whitaker's place?\n[00:41:20] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: Yeah, let's do it.\n[00:41:23] GM: so\n[00:41:24] GM: Ysidor, Nyx\n[00:41:26] GM: Ellara's like on the line\n[00:41:28] GM: anything you do during this like I guess\n[00:41:31] GM: we'll say\n[00:41:32] GM: almost an hour they were gone\n[00:41:35] GM: it took a lot longer to get there\n[00:41:36] GM: so\n[00:41:36] GM: what's the point of staying up there than expect it\n[00:41:41] Nyx: we're just eating\n[00:41:42] Berridin: I kind of forget that we have the...\n[00:41:43] Berridin: We're standing stone, so I'm like, I guess I didn't really need to do this. But anyways, we're back. We're back at Whitaker's place.\n[00:41:52] Berridin: Nyx, Nyx, my friend. We're going to need... I know. Nyx, we're going to try to procure a hot air balloon.\n[00:41:59] Ellara: just, like, silent for one hour, waiting.\n[00:42:02] GM: yeah everyone at Whitaker's house just like\n[00:42:08] Nyx: all of his food and drink\n[00:42:10] Nyx: why a hot air\n[00:42:19] Berridin: We're going to need someone... Whitaker seems to be quite confident.\n[00:42:21] Nyx: boiler that's gonna take\n[00:42:22] Nyx: does anybody here know how to\n[00:42:25] Nyx: use one okay\n[00:42:27] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: I know gas.\n[00:42:28] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: I understand the laws of thermodynamics.\n[00:42:29] Berridin: Yeah, he's, like, a gas-related person.\n[00:42:33] Nyx: I mean so do I it doesn't mean I know\n[00:42:34] Berridin: Whitaker, can you make, like, a Hindenburg-esque helium balloon? Hydrogen balloon?\n[00:42:38] Nyx: how to fly one\n[00:42:47] Nyx: no hydrogen\n[00:42:51] Berridin: Do you have a way to make a non-flammable light gas?\n[00:42:57] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: Hmm.\n[00:42:59] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: Argon?\n[00:43:01] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: Can I make argon somehow?\n[00:43:02] Nyx: oh boy oh boy oh boy oh boy\n[00:43:04] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: A large, large amount.\n[00:43:09] GM: before we solve this problem I would address getting the hot air balloon\n[00:43:12] Berridin: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n[00:43:13] Berridin: Okay, okay, let's get the hot air balloon.\n[00:43:17] Berridin: Nyx, Nyx, we need... Whitaker is apparently a poor person.\n[00:43:21] Berridin: So, Nyx, you're the only one here that has enough...\n[00:43:25] Berridin: ...money to help us, so...\n[00:43:27] Nyx: how much is it\n[00:43:29] Berridin: Um...\n[00:43:29] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: I'm money poor.\n[00:43:30] Berridin: About...\n[00:43:30] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: Okay.\n[00:43:30] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: Not a poor person.\n[00:43:31] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: I'm just a billionaire down on his luck.\n[00:43:35] Berridin: It's...\n[00:43:35] Berridin: Just like MAGA.\n[00:43:37] GM: to be fair you haven't checked your account\n[00:43:40] GM: so you don't know how much is in the bank right now either\n[00:43:41] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: Oh, that's just all I have on me.\n[00:43:43] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: That's all I have on me.\n[00:43:44] Berridin: Okay, that's fair. We... I don't... Yeah, okay.\n[00:43:44] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: I don't know what I'm no mathematician, but I think she said a hundred gold.\n[00:43:47] Berridin: Um, Nyx, it's going to be about 200 gold.\n[00:43:52] Ysidor: I just want the Easter to go in his pockets\n[00:43:53] Berridin: Yeah, 200... 200 gold.\n[00:43:55] Berridin: 2-0-0.\n[00:43:56] Nyx: no\n[00:43:57] Berridin: Look, we're flying in the air, okay?\n[00:44:00] Ysidor: and pulls out, like, two coppers.\n[00:44:02] Nyx: yeah\n[00:44:02] Ysidor: Just, like, look to them as, like,\n[00:44:08] Berridin: Okay, Nyx, it's going to be a little pricey.\n[00:44:10] Berridin: Unless you want to get some...\n[00:44:11] Berridin: Backwards, you know, a little...\n[00:44:12] Nyx: I don't have that kind of funds on me\n[00:44:16] Berridin: You opened up...\n[00:44:18] Berridin: ...\n[00:44:21] Berridin: Whitaker!\n[00:44:22] Berridin: God damn it!\n[00:44:24] Ellara: Lara asks...\n[00:44:25] Nyx: I hear I might hear that\n[00:44:26] Ellara: I assume Lara's still in the chat.\n[00:44:28] Ellara: She'll go...\n[00:44:28] Nyx: yeah yeah yeah\n[00:44:29] Ysidor: just...\n[00:44:30] Ellara: What do you mean hot air balloon?\n[00:44:30] Ysidor: Ysidor just...\n[00:44:33] Ellara: Like, in the sky?\n[00:44:35] Berridin: Yeah, um...\n[00:44:38] Berridin: We're going to get there as the crow flies.\n[00:44:42] Ellara: She's like...\n[00:44:42] Nyx: okay\n[00:44:43] Ellara: She's like, um...\n[00:44:45] Ellara: How...\n[00:44:45] Ellara: How does that work?\n[00:44:46] Ellara: I am assuming hot air balloons\n[00:44:48] Ellara: just don't really exist outside of big cities.\n[00:44:52] Ellara: Jacinta implied they only recently got here,\n[00:44:54] Ellara: so she's like...\n[00:44:57] Ellara: What?\n[00:45:00] Nyx: Berridin can you explain the plan\n[00:45:01] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: Wind and heat, my dear wind.\n[00:45:03] Nyx: ex\n[00:45:03] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: And yeah, there's a basket.\n[00:45:04] Nyx: explain first off it's not 200 gold\n[00:45:07] Nyx: Berridin\n[00:45:09] Nyx: we had we talked about this\n[00:45:11] Nyx: Berridin\n[00:45:12] Ellara: She just goes back and says,\n[00:45:13] Ellara: but you're saying in the sky,\n[00:45:14] Ellara: not on the ground.\n[00:45:17] Berridin: Yeah, um...\n[00:45:19] Berridin: Nyx, it's a finder's fee.\n[00:45:19] Ellara: Is that safe?\n[00:45:20] Berridin: The finder's fee that I was talking about is the Georgia Gold.\n[00:45:22] Ellara: Is that safe?\n[00:45:24] Berridin: Ellara, it's totally safe.\n[00:45:26] Berridin: It's totally safe, yeah.\n[00:45:27] Nyx: I take out a knife\n[00:45:28] Berridin: And it's faster.\n[00:45:29] Nyx: I take out a knife\n[00:45:29] Ysidor: Ysidor just raises his hand and goes,\n[00:45:31] Nyx: and I start playing with the knife\n[00:45:33] Nyx: and I look at Berridin and I go\n[00:45:34] Nyx: finder's fee\n[00:45:36] Nyx: so how long\n[00:45:39] GM: also\n[00:45:41] Ysidor: personally, I prefer the ground,\n[00:45:43] Ysidor: but that's just me.\n[00:45:46] Nyx: will this hot air balloon\n[00:45:48] Nyx: take and what are\n[00:45:50] Nyx: our other options\n[00:45:51] Nyx: carriage\n[00:45:53] Ellara: How do you control a hot air balloon?\n[00:45:54] Nyx: a dirigible yeah\n[00:45:55] Berridin: These are all great questions that we can ask the hot air balloon person.\n[00:45:56] Ellara: She asks.\n[00:46:03] Berridin: But...\n[00:46:04] Berridin: Maybe using some back-of-the-envelope math,\n[00:46:08] Berridin: um, can I motion towards Whitaker to...\n[00:46:12] Berridin: Maybe Whitaker would know, kind of, uh,\n[00:46:15] Berridin: the math behind how long it would take to reach here.\n[00:46:19] Berridin: Um, yeah.\n[00:46:19] Ellara: Also, just a question.\n[00:46:20] Ellara: In this world,\n[00:46:21] Ellara: when we're talking about hot air balloons,\n[00:46:23] Ellara: is it, like, the circular?\n[00:46:24] Ellara: Or is it more like a limb?\n[00:46:28] Nyx: yeah it's not an airship\n[00:46:28] Ysidor: I would assume a circular one,\n[00:46:31] Ysidor: like, around the world and...\n[00:46:33] Nyx: it's an actual hot air balloon\n[00:46:35] Nyx: yeah\n[00:46:36] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: There's a basket.\n[00:46:37] GM: yeah it's going to be a basket it's not a dirigible and I don't think it's a good idea to have a lot of money on it\n[00:46:37] Nyx: if there's a basket\n[00:46:38] GM: it's going to be a basket it's not a dirigible and it's not going to be in the bank either\n[00:46:39] GM: you're going to have to return it and then you're going to have to pay for it\n[00:46:39] Nyx: yeah\n[00:46:40] GM: and then you're going to have to pay for it\n[00:46:40] GM: and Lady Jacinta said\n[00:46:41] Nyx: yeah\n[00:46:43] GM: a cheap one at\n[00:46:45] GM: 100 gold starting roughly\n[00:46:47] GM: not she's\n[00:46:47] Berridin: Oh, yeah.\n[00:46:47] Nyx: yeah\n[00:46:48] GM: roughly\n[00:46:49] Berridin: Thank you.\n[00:46:50] GM: point of clarification\n[00:46:51] Nyx: this is this is stupid\n[00:46:52] Berridin: Thank you, narrator.\n[00:46:53] GM: and it's bespoke\n[00:46:53] Berridin: Actually, we might need more than 100 gold.\n[00:46:56] Berridin: Uh, just to reiterate,\n[00:46:57] Ysidor: I agree for the ground.\n[00:46:59] Berridin: if you wanted a flying style, Nyx,\n[00:47:01] Berridin: I don't know how much...\n[00:47:02] GM: just letting you know\n[00:47:03] Berridin: And it has to be purple, okay?\n[00:47:04] GM: what is it a shark tank now\n[00:47:07] Nyx: okay look\n[00:47:09] Ellara: And Ellara's like,\n[00:47:09] Ellara: I don't think it's natural\n[00:47:09] Nyx: there yeah\n[00:47:11] Ellara: for us to be flying around like that.\n[00:47:13] Ellara: The light would have given us wings\n[00:47:15] Ellara: if it intended for us to fly.\n[00:47:15] Nyx: okay\n[00:47:18] Nyx: I agree with Ellara for different reasons\n[00:47:22] Nyx: coming from a different place but\n[00:47:24] Nyx: it's the same place\n[00:47:25] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: Let me tell you, we'll find out.\n[00:47:26] Nyx: so first off how big is this basket\n[00:47:28] Nyx: can we even fit if I were to entertain this idea\n[00:47:30] Nyx: if I were to entertain this idea\n[00:47:32] Nyx: can you even fit everybody\n[00:47:34] Berridin: Look, we might not know it,\n[00:47:34] Nyx: I don't care how we use it\n[00:47:36] Berridin: but Whitaker is a brilliant, um,\n[00:47:39] Berridin: intelligent alchemist here,\n[00:47:42] Berridin: and he's going to explain to you the mechanics\n[00:47:44] Berridin: of how we use this hot air balloon.\n[00:47:48] Nyx: I want to know\n[00:47:49] Berridin: It's going to ha-\n[00:47:50] Berridin: Okay, okay, I know you have a bloodthirsty look in your eyes right now, Nyx.\n[00:47:50] Nyx: can it fit everybody\n[00:47:52] Nyx: and you you said we're going to get somebody to use it for us\n[00:47:56] Nyx: at least that's what you implied\n[00:47:58] Nyx: we're not taking anyone with us\n[00:48:00] Nyx: so we need to use a vehicle that we take\n[00:48:02] Nyx: that we can drive\n[00:48:04] Nyx: or else we're going to have to take care of that person at the end of the trip\n[00:48:08] Nyx: because we don't want people to know where we've been\n[00:48:10] Nyx: that's not what I said\n[00:48:12] Nyx: but\n[00:48:17] Berridin: You don't have to kill the pilot\n[00:48:18] Berridin: just because he's taking us there.\n[00:48:19] Berridin: But, I think...\n[00:48:20] Nyx: how long is this going to\n[00:48:21] Berridin: I think Whitaker can take us.\n[00:48:22] Nyx: are we going to be in the air for three months\n[00:48:23] Berridin: Whitaker, can you fly this thing?\n[00:48:26] Berridin: I think Whitaker would be able to fly this.\n[00:48:28] Nyx: are we going to be in the air for three months\n[00:48:30] Nyx: are we going to be in the air for three months\n[00:48:32] Nyx: because once we go up\n[00:48:34] Berridin: No!\n[00:48:34] Nyx: okay\n[00:48:34] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: Oh, no, no.\n[00:48:34] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: It should take somewhere.\n[00:48:35] Berridin: Oh, okay.\n[00:48:35] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: I mean, depending on the way the wind's blowing, you know, anywhere from, you know, a week to six months.\n[00:48:47] Ysidor: Yeah.\n[00:48:50] Nyx: all right let's\n[00:48:50] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: I mean, it depends on which way.\n[00:48:52] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: I don't know how big this planet is, but it depends on which way we go.\n[00:48:56] Berridin: Whitaker, do you have, like, a map in your home?\n[00:48:56] Nyx: okay guys\n[00:49:00] Berridin: Does he have a map?\n[00:49:01] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: Yeah, I definitely have like a big, like black and white map.\n[00:49:06] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: Like little pins stuck in it of like, uh, my favorite places to get food.\n[00:49:11] Berridin: Let's all huddle around the map.\n[00:49:11] Nyx: so you don't have a\n[00:49:13] Berridin: Let's just analyze what's going on here.\n[00:49:13] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: Hold on.\n[00:49:15] Berridin: Is it okay, Bobby?\n[00:49:16] Nyx: so you don't have a plan\n[00:49:17] Berridin: Yeah.\n[00:49:18] Berridin: We have a plan.\n[00:49:18] Nyx: so you\n[00:49:20] Berridin: The plan is to fly there.\n[00:49:22] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: We have, we have the concept of a plan.\n[00:49:24] Nyx: so you come to us\n[00:49:25] Berridin: We have a concept.\n[00:49:26] Nyx: with perhaps\n[00:49:27] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: I, yeah, mine's minus one.\n[00:49:28] Nyx: the worst way to go\n[00:49:30] Nyx: to get there\n[00:49:32] Nyx: and you don't even pitch us on it\n[00:49:34] Nyx: you just say hey guys\n[00:49:36] Nyx: here's our milk toast idea\n[00:49:38] Nyx: and\n[00:49:40] Nyx: help us figure out how we're going to do it\n[00:49:42] Nyx: well as Mr. Moneybags\n[00:49:43] Berridin: You know, to be fair,\n[00:49:44] Berridin: I definitely underestimated the lack of enthusiasm\n[00:49:46] Berridin: in this party to go flying.\n[00:49:49] Berridin: But...\n[00:49:49] Berridin: Yeah, that's your choice of words.\n[00:49:51] Nyx: well as Mr. Moneybags\n[00:49:53] Nyx: as the one who would be\n[00:49:55] Nyx: let's be honest\n[00:49:57] Nyx: single-handedly funding this entire thing\n[00:49:59] Nyx: I need more\n[00:50:01] Nyx: to go off of\n[00:50:01] Ysidor: 30% stake.\n[00:50:04] Berridin: Okay, yeah, let's look at it.\n[00:50:05] Berridin: Let's look at the map.\n[00:50:07] Nyx: you look at it\n[00:50:08] Berridin: Okay, I'm looking at the map.\n[00:50:09] Nyx: and you come back to me\n[00:50:10] Berridin: Okay.\n[00:50:11] Nyx: and present me\n[00:50:12] Berridin: I'm looking at the map.\n[00:50:13] Nyx: and present me\n[00:50:14] GM: I would say\n[00:50:15] Nyx: Nyx\n[00:50:17] Nyx: Nyx is like so over the bad idea\n[00:50:19] Nyx: because he's like\n[00:50:21] Nyx: we literally can be killed during this trip\n[00:50:23] Berridin: Okay.\n[00:50:23] Nyx: and there's no way I'm going to get killed\n[00:50:24] Berridin: Okay.\n[00:50:24] Berridin: Who has the best...\n[00:50:25] Nyx: in a hot air balloon\n[00:50:27] Nyx: like fish in a barrel\n[00:50:30] Berridin: Who has the best map skills in our party?\n[00:50:36] GM: if it's reading a map you can\n[00:50:38] GM: roll survival\n[00:50:39] GM: here\n[00:50:40] Nyx: all of us\n[00:50:41] Ysidor: I just said math,\n[00:50:42] Berridin: What about...\n[00:50:42] Ysidor: and I was like, oh...\n[00:50:44] Berridin: Yeah, who are the survivalists?\n[00:50:44] Nyx: Ysidor's actually great at calculus\n[00:50:44] Ysidor: Yeah.\n[00:50:46] Nyx: not really\n[00:50:49] Ellara: Savant.\n[00:50:50] Berridin: Is it Nyx?\n[00:50:51] Berridin: Nyx has wisdom?\n[00:50:53] Nyx: actually yes\n[00:50:54] Ysidor: None of us really...\n[00:50:55] GM: wait and I will say\n[00:50:56] Ellara: In character, or...\n[00:50:57] GM: Ellara wouldn't be able to\n[00:50:57] Nyx: it might be me\n[00:51:00] GM: and if Ellara wanted\n[00:51:00] Ellara: Yeah, I can't.\n[00:51:02] GM: to roll it would be disadvantageous because she's\n[00:51:04] GM: not there\n[00:51:04] GM: I mean\n[00:51:05] Ellara: Yeah, yeah.\n[00:51:06] Ellara: I'd have to look at my own map.\n[00:51:06] Nyx: yeah yeah yeah\n[00:51:06] Ysidor: Oh, sure, I forgot.\n[00:51:08] Berridin: Can Whitaker use his intelligence instead of wisdom?\n[00:51:14] Ysidor: I have a zero and, like, survive.\n[00:51:17] Ysidor: Like, I can roll.\n[00:51:17] Ysidor: Like, it's just gonna...\n[00:51:18] Ysidor: I'm gonna roll flat, basically.\n[00:51:20] GM: I would\n[00:51:22] GM: allow Whitaker to use intelligence\n[00:51:22] Nyx: which pisses me off\n[00:51:24] Nyx: because I don't want to be involved in this\n[00:51:28] GM: but\n[00:51:28] Nyx: Nyx just doesn't want to do it\n[00:51:29] GM: everyone else is survival\n[00:51:32] GM: I would say\n[00:51:33] GM: Nyx has a 16\n[00:51:35] GM: no\n[00:51:37] Berridin: Yeah, Nyx.\n[00:51:37] Berridin: Nyx, what are you talking about?\n[00:51:38] Ysidor: Okay.\n[00:51:42] Berridin: Okay.\n[00:51:43] Ysidor: Well...\n[00:51:44] Berridin: Well, Whitaker, like...\n[00:51:44] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: Look, if you, if you tell me how far it is, I can tell you how long it'll take us to get there.\n[00:51:45] Nyx: all right show me the map\n[00:51:47] Berridin: Let's...\n[00:51:47] Nyx: okay\n[00:51:48] Berridin: Whitaker and you.\n[00:51:53] Berridin: Oh.\n[00:51:53] Berridin: I like that.\n[00:51:55] Nyx: so can I\n[00:51:57] Nyx: what do I roll to figure that out\n[00:51:58] GM: 16 you're already\n[00:51:59] Nyx: to look at the map\n[00:52:00] GM: anyways point being\n[00:52:01] Nyx: it's not there\n[00:52:02] GM: you have a 16\n[00:52:02] GM: you already know it's four weeks\n[00:52:05] GM: it's about north north west\n[00:52:07] GM: of the city\n[00:52:08] GM: it takes about four weeks by foot\n[00:52:10] GM: to get there\n[00:52:11] GM: if you took a hot air balloon\n[00:52:12] Berridin: Okay.\n[00:52:12] Nyx: okay\n[00:52:13] Berridin: Okay.\n[00:52:15] GM: with all the right\n[00:52:16] GM: things you could definitely\n[00:52:19] GM: cut down the time\n[00:52:20] GM: however as Whitaker kind of\n[00:52:21] Nyx: yeah\n[00:52:23] GM: had the realization\n[00:52:25] GM: I can't remember if you shared\n[00:52:26] GM: whatever they're bringing\n[00:52:28] GM: the war is going to happen\n[00:52:28] GM: and they're going to have a lot of\n[00:52:28] GM: more forges\n[00:52:29] GM: would take longer\n[00:52:30] GM: but they would\n[00:52:31] GM: would probably\n[00:52:32] GM: so here's the thing\n[00:52:33] GM: you could get there faster\n[00:52:34] GM: by like carriage horseback\n[00:52:36] GM: it would take you less than four weeks\n[00:52:36] Nyx: yeah yeah yeah\n[00:52:38] GM: yeah\n[00:52:42] Nyx: that's it okay\n[00:52:44] GM: so it would take\n[00:52:45] GM: any kind of transportation\n[00:52:47] GM: would take less than four weeks\n[00:52:48] GM: an army\n[00:52:50] GM: a large army or something moving\n[00:52:52] GM: or with like\n[00:52:54] GM: what do you call it\n[00:52:55] GM: with like cargo\n[00:52:56] GM: heavy cargo\n[00:52:56] GM: would probably almost go\n[00:52:58] GM: as fast as\n[00:52:59] GM: on foot\n[00:53:00] GM: so it's about four weeks\n[00:53:01] GM: if you guys were just alone\n[00:53:03] GM: in carriage\n[00:53:04] GM: kind of pushing it right\n[00:53:06] GM: you could probably\n[00:53:07] GM: do\n[00:53:08] GM: about\n[00:53:11] GM: on carriage\n[00:53:13] GM: about two weeks\n[00:53:14] GM: and kind of pushing it\n[00:53:16] GM: it would depend on the favorability\n[00:53:16] Nyx: and the hot air balloon\n[00:53:18] Nyx: is just it's just less\n[00:53:20] Nyx: we don't know by how much\n[00:53:22] Nyx: right oh\n[00:53:23] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: Well, if you tell me how far it is.\n[00:53:25] GM: of the wind\n[00:53:25] GM: okay\n[00:53:27] Ellara: Yeah.\n[00:53:27] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: Yeah, I can, I can figure out the, so what I would like to do is walk over to dinner.\n[00:53:28] Ellara: You might just never make it.\n[00:53:30] Berridin: Yeah.\n[00:53:30] Berridin: Okay.\n[00:53:30] Nyx: what's the distance\n[00:53:32] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: Okay.\n[00:53:32] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: With a pair of scissors and cut off a little, a little bit of hair and then pop open a window, just a, just a lock and, and I'm going to just walk to the window and I'm going to open up the window and I'm going to throw the hairs out the window to see how fast they like go by to judge the speed of the wind right now.\n[00:53:38] Berridin: You cut off my...\n[00:53:38] Berridin: Okay.\n[00:53:47] Nyx: yeah\n[00:53:54] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: Can I do that?\n[00:53:55] Ysidor: This is doing the Wednesday's constant, too.\n[00:53:58] Ysidor: Like, it's big as I'm trying to say.\n[00:53:59] GM: roll an intelligence check\n[00:53:59] Nyx: there's a lot of assumptions\n[00:54:01] Nyx: but we got to start somewhere\n[00:54:05] GM: because there's nothing\n[00:54:06] GM: there's no ability this would be\n[00:54:08] GM: with advantage\n[00:54:10] Berridin: Roll again.\n[00:54:11] GM: okay\n[00:54:12] GM: roll like\n[00:54:12] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: Oh, with advantage.\n[00:54:13] GM: yeah roll again\n[00:54:13] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: Sorry.\n[00:54:15] GM: take the highest\n[00:54:15] Berridin: Yeah.\n[00:54:16] GM: well\n[00:54:17] Nyx: Whitaker's actually a witch\n[00:54:17] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: There you go.\n[00:54:20] Ysidor: Yeah.\n[00:54:21] Nyx: controls the wind\n[00:54:22] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: Uh, the highest was 12.\n[00:54:23] GM: um\n[00:54:24] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: I'm here too.\n[00:54:25] GM: you would\n[00:54:26] GM: you would say\n[00:54:27] GM: if you could keep the winds\n[00:54:29] GM: favorable\n[00:54:30] GM: um\n[00:54:32] GM: you could probably also do it\n[00:54:33] GM: in two weeks\n[00:54:34] GM: with the hot air\n[00:54:35] Berridin: Oh, that's like...\n[00:54:36] Nyx: oh yeah\n[00:54:37] GM: with the hot air balloon\n[00:54:38] GM: if the winds were favorable\n[00:54:40] Berridin: End in style.\n[00:54:40] Nyx: huh\n[00:54:42] GM: if if they weren't favorable\n[00:54:42] Berridin: Look.\n[00:54:42] Nyx: right right\n[00:54:44] Berridin: And we're gonna...\n[00:54:45] Berridin: We're gonna...\n[00:54:45] Berridin: This is gonna be our...\n[00:54:47] Berridin: Okay, I'm just...\n[00:54:48] Berridin: Okay.\n[00:54:50] GM: like you said\n[00:54:51] Berridin: Yeah.\n[00:54:53] GM: it could take three weeks\n[00:54:55] GM: it could take four weeks\n[00:54:57] GM: it could take three weeks\n[00:54:57] GM: it could take four weeks\n[00:54:57] GM: it could take three weeks\n[00:54:57] GM: it could\n[00:54:57] Ellara: You could end up somewhere\n[00:54:58] GM: I will just say\n[00:54:59] Ellara: completely different.\n[00:54:59] Ellara: I think out of character,\n[00:55:01] Berridin: Okay, okay.\n[00:55:02] Berridin: I believe in us.\n[00:55:02] Nyx: well we can always drop the boon\n[00:55:03] Berridin: I'm just...\n[00:55:04] Berridin: I'm speaking out of...\n[00:55:04] Nyx: the balloon right\n[00:55:05] Berridin: Out of character right now.\n[00:55:07] Berridin: I believe in us.\n[00:55:08] Berridin: This can be our...\n[00:55:10] Berridin: Our transportation, this campaign around.\n[00:55:13] Berridin: Oh, yeah.\n[00:55:14] GM: I will require\n[00:55:15] GM: some kind of skill check\n[00:55:16] GM: if you use the hot air balloon\n[00:55:17] GM: to get there\n[00:55:18] GM: and like\n[00:55:18] Nyx: oh no of course\n[00:55:19] Berridin: Okay, okay.\n[00:55:20] GM: if it goes bad\n[00:55:20] Berridin: That's fine.\n[00:55:20] Nyx: look yeah\n[00:55:21] GM: it goes bad\n[00:55:22] Ellara: without somebody\n[00:55:23] GM: I mean\n[00:55:23] Ellara: to control the winds,\n[00:55:25] Ellara: I don't think\n[00:55:25] Ellara: this will ever work for us.\n[00:55:28] Ellara: We need someone,\n[00:55:29] Ellara: because from what I know\n[00:55:30] Ellara: about hot air balloons,\n[00:55:31] Ellara: if the winds are against you,\n[00:55:33] Ellara: you are just not making it.\n[00:55:33] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: So, so could we procure some horses and hang them from ropes from the hot air balloon so that if it happens, we have an additional one, or we can like float just high enough off the ground.\n[00:55:35] Ellara: This is not like rowing\n[00:55:35] Nyx: yeah we have to drop\n[00:55:36] Ellara: or, like, a ship\n[00:55:37] Nyx: yeah\n[00:55:38] Ellara: where you can tack.\n[00:55:39] Ellara: You just can't.\n[00:55:42] Berridin: Look, I think eventually we can implement some sort of jet engine on the hot air balloon.\n[00:55:42] Ellara: It'll push you away.\n[00:55:49] Nyx: eventually\n[00:55:50] Ellara: That's going to be the industry.\n[00:55:51] Nyx: yeah that's what it's gonna\n[00:55:52] Ellara: Jet propulsion.\n[00:55:53] Nyx: we're actually gonna\n[00:55:55] Nyx: we're gonna mod our air balloon\n[00:55:57] Nyx: to have jet engines\n[00:55:59] Nyx: steam engines\n[00:56:01] Nyx: let's go\n[00:56:03] Nyx: there we go oh man\n[00:56:04] Ellara: We're going to develop\n[00:56:05] Ellara: space.\n[00:56:05] Ellara: Steampunk aviation in this world.\n[00:56:07] Nyx: there we go oh man\n[00:56:08] Berridin: Okay.\n[00:56:10] GM: eventually Light Crystals\n[00:56:12] GM: who knows what they're gonna make\n[00:56:13] GM: but um\n[00:56:14] GM: um\n[00:56:16] GM: yeah\n[00:56:16] Ellara: If only a great researcher hadn't died.\n[00:56:17] GM: yeah\n[00:56:20] GM: if only Michelle Faberge\n[00:56:22] GM: wasn't murdered brutally\n[00:56:23] GM: I would say\n[00:56:26] GM: it was all out of character\n[00:56:26] Ysidor: I guess we'll never know.\n[00:56:30] GM: oh\n[00:56:33] Nyx: look it's either\n[00:56:35] Berridin: So, there is potential for this hot air balloon.\n[00:56:39] Berridin: But in the spirit of diplomacy...\n[00:56:43] Berridin: Do you guys want to, like, take a vote on what we want to do?\n[00:56:47] Berridin: Or do you want to...\n[00:56:49] Berridin: Want to, like, see if we can procure a carriage that's faster?\n[00:56:55] Berridin: We're gonna...\n[00:56:56] Berridin: We're gonna...\n[00:56:58] Berridin: Eventually, we're gonna return to the hot air balloon.\n[00:57:00] Ysidor: Eventually, all things go back to the compass.\n[00:57:01] Berridin: Eventually, we're gonna return to the hot air balloon.\n[00:57:04] Berridin: I just want to...\n[00:57:04] Berridin: I just want to point that out there.\n[00:57:06] Ellara: He's like, I'm going to make it happen.\n[00:57:07] Berridin: It's gonna happen.\n[00:57:07] Ellara: This will be our new...\n[00:57:09] Ellara: What was it?\n[00:57:10] Ellara: The slave?\n[00:57:12] Ellara: Like, bone dragon?\n[00:57:15] Ellara: A bone dog?\n[00:57:16] Ellara: I don't remember what the creatures were.\n[00:57:17] Ellara: The lizards?\n[00:57:18] GM: oh yeah\n[00:57:18] Ysidor: Oh, Larry.\n[00:57:19] Ysidor: Turtle.\n[00:57:20] GM: well also you're fine\n[00:57:22] GM: you're fine\n[00:57:22] GM: both of you casting like\n[00:57:23] GM: fine steed and creating\n[00:57:25] GM: and having\n[00:57:25] Berridin: Yeah.\n[00:57:26] GM: martial character creating crafts\n[00:57:28] GM: and shit\n[00:57:30] Ysidor: Yeah.\n[00:57:31] Ysidor: I mean, level five, I can call a noble steed.\n[00:57:32] Berridin: Yeah.\n[00:57:34] Ysidor: I can just make them appear, basically.\n[00:57:37] Berridin: Yeah.\n[00:57:37] Ysidor: I don't think so.\n[00:57:38] Berridin: Yeah.\n[00:57:39] Berridin: Can you make one appear with, like...\n[00:57:41] Berridin: Like a...\n[00:57:41] Berridin: Pegasus wings style?\n[00:57:47] Berridin: Okay.\n[00:57:48] Berridin: We're gonna...\n[00:57:48] Berridin: We're gonna...\n[00:57:49] Berridin: We're gonna start planning ahead.\n[00:57:51] Berridin: Okay?\n[00:57:51] Berridin: We're gonna start planning ahead.\n[00:57:51] Ysidor: I'll workshop that.\n[00:57:53] GM: who works up\n[00:57:53] Berridin: Okay.\n[00:57:53] Ysidor: Let's see.\n[00:57:54] Berridin: Let me...\n[00:57:54] Berridin: Let me try one more thing.\n[00:57:54] Ysidor: I wonder why.\n[00:57:56] Berridin: I'm gonna go around to each person.\n[00:57:58] Berridin: Berridin goes up to Ysidor.\n[00:57:59] Berridin: And he senses the trepidation in his...\n[00:58:02] Berridin: In his voice.\n[00:58:04] Berridin: And I say...\n[00:58:06] Berridin: Ysidor.\n[00:58:07] Berridin: You know, you're such a...\n[00:58:10] Berridin: You have one less...\n[00:58:12] Berridin: Last element to conquer.\n[00:58:13] Berridin: You've conquered the Earth.\n[00:58:15] Berridin: And then...\n[00:58:16] Berridin: I gaze up at him.\n[00:58:18] Berridin: Even though I'm three feet below him.\n[00:58:20] Berridin: And I say, think about what you could conquer in the skies.\n[00:58:24] Berridin: And...\n[00:58:25] Berridin: Okay.\n[00:58:25] Berridin: Berridin is really feeling himself.\n[00:58:27] Berridin: As if this is some profound notion to Ysidor.\n[00:58:31] Berridin: So he walks over to Ellara.\n[00:58:33] Berridin: And then...\n[00:58:34] GM: Ellara's not there\n[00:58:34] Ellara: I'm not there.\n[00:58:34] Ellara: I'm on the stone.\n[00:58:36] Berridin: What?\n[00:58:36] Berridin: Sorry?\n[00:58:37] Ellara: I'm on the stone.\n[00:58:38] Berridin: Ellara's not there?\n[00:58:39] GM: no\n[00:58:39] Berridin: Oh, shit.\n[00:58:39] Berridin: Ellara's not there.\n[00:58:39] Ellara: Yeah, yeah.\n[00:58:40] Berridin: Okay.\n[00:58:40] Berridin: Goes up to Nyx.\n[00:58:43] Berridin: Nyx.\n[00:58:43] Berridin: Nyx.\n[00:58:44] Berridin: This is, you know, a really, really great place to flex your fancy wardrobe.\n[00:58:55] Berridin: And I think that there is some potential here from your angle.\n[00:59:00] Berridin: And that we can get there really, really fast.\n[00:59:06] Berridin: Yeah.\n[00:59:08] Nyx: I'm warming to the idea\n[00:59:10] Nyx: the issue is is that\n[00:59:12] Nyx: if\n[00:59:14] Nyx: if the winds are not in our favor\n[00:59:16] Nyx: if the weather is not in our favor\n[00:59:18] Nyx: we could go from\n[00:59:20] Nyx: cutting let's say\n[00:59:22] Nyx: this time in half\n[00:59:24] Nyx: to get there\n[00:59:26] Nyx: to doubling the time it takes\n[00:59:27] Berridin: Yeah.\n[00:59:28] Nyx: right because then if there's a problem\n[00:59:30] Nyx: we have to stop\n[00:59:32] Nyx: we have to land\n[00:59:34] Nyx: and then we have to wait\n[00:59:36] Nyx: this is my\n[00:59:38] Nyx: trepidation\n[00:59:58] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: So like the horses can run while they like pull the balloon above them.\n[01:00:04] Berridin: Holy shit.\n[01:00:04] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: Kind of like a kite.\n[01:00:05] Berridin: It's like a hot air carriage.\n[01:00:08] Berridin: It's like a floating carriage.\n[01:00:08] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: Yeah.\n[01:00:11] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: And then, and then think, think how far we'll be able to see.\n[01:00:12] Nyx: that works that way\n[01:00:14] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: And, and.\n[01:00:15] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: You know, it'll be beautiful though.\n[01:00:22] Nyx: fortune favors the brave\n[01:00:24] Nyx: okay\n[01:00:26] Nyx: let's just let's okay\n[01:00:28] Nyx: I'm fine with the hot air balloon\n[01:00:30] Nyx: but I want to only\n[01:00:32] Nyx: but I but you you wait\n[01:00:34] Nyx: hang on\n[01:00:36] Berridin: Okay.\n[01:00:36] Nyx: you gotta get me the cheapest price\n[01:00:37] Berridin: Yeah.\n[01:00:38] Berridin: Yeah.\n[01:00:38] Berridin: We're going to do that.\n[01:00:38] Nyx: you gotta try\n[01:00:40] Nyx: okay\n[01:00:41] GM: what\n[01:00:42] Nyx: and if I find out\n[01:00:44] Nyx: that you're that you're taking off the top\n[01:00:45] Berridin: Yeah.\n[01:00:48] Berridin: Why are you looking at me?\n[01:00:51] Ysidor: Who else would you look at?\n[01:00:52] Nyx: just understood understood yeah you brought this to us so now you take responsibility\n[01:00:56] Berridin: I feel like I've been the most honest one here.\n[01:01:02] Berridin: Okay.\n[01:01:02] Nyx: okay okay i'll go so Nyx looks at Whitaker and just thinks for a second and puts like a hand like\n[01:01:03] Berridin: Okay.\n[01:01:03] Berridin: Okay.\n[01:01:03] Berridin: We'll do it.\n[01:01:04] Berridin: We'll do it.\n[01:01:04] Berridin: We'll go together.\n[01:01:06] Berridin: People like me.\n[01:01:07] Berridin: Yeah.\n[01:01:07] Berridin: I'm ready to...\n[01:01:08] Berridin: I'm ready to haggle.\n[01:01:10] GM: so\n[01:01:11] GM: who's all going to\n[01:01:16] GM: um\n[01:01:17] GM: I'll just remind you\n[01:01:18] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: Can I just, I just, I just wanted to know that, you know, I really, I really have come around to and trust him.\n[01:01:19] GM: I'll just remind you\n[01:01:28] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: I don't appreciate you not, you know, believing that at his word, he's, he's been over the highest, the highest level of integrity with me at all times.\n[01:01:37] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: The man never lied to me once.\n[01:01:41] Berridin: Yes.\n[01:01:48] Nyx: taps him on the shoulder and goes you're a good guy and then just walks away like just walks and\n[01:01:58] Nyx: he goes all right let's go i look at at Berridin and all right let's go lead the way i am i am disguising\n[01:02:05] Berridin: Okay.\n[01:02:06] Berridin: I think Whitaker should come too, by the way.\n[01:02:08] Berridin: Let's go to the...\n[01:02:09] Berridin: Let's go to the hot air balloon shop.\n[01:02:10] GM: I'll just remind you\n[01:02:11] GM: um\n[01:02:12] GM: by the way\n[01:02:13] GM: um\n[01:02:13] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: I'll get us a deal.\n[01:02:14] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: No one does know this.\n[01:02:14] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: Let's see.\n[01:02:17] GM: just uh\n[01:02:18] GM: you're not disguising selves\n[01:02:19] GM: or anything\n[01:02:20] GM: um\n[01:02:21] GM: okay\n[01:02:22] GM: Nyx is\n[01:02:23] GM: is Ysidor coming\n[01:02:23] Nyx: myself does he want to Ysidor you want to come all right let's go all right

balloon is, but...\n[01:02:36] Ysidor: Sounds like fun.\n[01:02:37] GM: um\n[01:02:38] Berridin: Oh.\n[01:02:38] Ellara: And Ellara says she'll go\n[01:02:39] Ellara: because she needs to see this\n[01:02:40] Ellara: because she does not think this is right.\n[01:02:43] Ellara: Are there other vehicles?\n[01:02:44] GM: I assume\n[01:02:45] GM: yes\n[01:02:46] GM: you're at Whitaker's house\n[01:02:47] GM: I\n[01:02:48] GM: yeah\n[01:02:49] GM: so I assume\n[01:02:50] GM: whatever disguise we're at\n[01:02:51] GM: Moose\n[01:02:51] Berridin: Oh, we're on the west.\n[01:02:52] GM:

receptionist?\n[01:04:41] Berridin: I don't know.\n[01:04:46] Berridin: Is it a human?\n[01:04:47] Berridin: Is it a dwarf?\n[01:04:51] Berridin: Oh, my God.\n[01:04:52] Berridin: Okay.\n[01:04:53] Berridin: Okay.\n[01:04:53] Berridin: I walk in.\n[01:04:54] Berridin: I walk in.\n[01:04:55] Berridin: I go up to the dwarf in my...\n[01:04:59] Berridin: Hello.\n[01:05:00] Berridin: We are looking to procure a hot air balloon, and we're looking...\n[01:05:07] Berridin: We heard this was the shop to go to.\n[01:05:10] GM: we've just started to take orders on hot air balloons\n[01:05:14] GM: um they've the fashion really uh pushed from Pharus over to here um seems some of the nobles\n[01:05:22] GM: want to see what all the rage is um yes so what kind of uh hot air balloon they're all made to\n[01:05:29] GM: order um any specific requirements you have purple okay purple we can do um purple dyes\n[01:05:34] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: Purple.\n[01:05:38] Berridin: Okay.\n[01:05:41] GM: tend to be more expensive but um yes\n[01:05:45] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: Oh, cost is not an issue.\n[01:05:46] Ysidor: It's like, comrades, she says.\n[01:05:47] Berridin: Please.\n[01:05:48] Berridin: Please.\n[01:05:48] Berridin: Please.\n[01:05:50] Berridin: My comrades are a bit all over the place.\n[01:05:51] Nyx: we would like\n[01:05:53] Nyx: you\n[01:05:54] Nyx: i shut up i lean in and i say\n[01:05:58] Berridin: We have a certain weight requirement, and can I...\n[01:06:05] GM: what would that be oh this is completely bespoke uh bespoke these are this is quite new um to\n[01:06:07] Berridin: 500 pounds?\n[01:06:12] Nyx: no just just for not by pounds you do by people like i would say how many what are we one two\n[01:06:13] Berridin: Is that five people?\n[01:06:19] Ysidor: The expert.\n[01:06:20] Nyx: three four five what are we six six people five but then we need an extra for Meri you always\n[01:06:24] Berridin: And six.\n[01:06:26] Berridin: What kind of...\n[01:06:27] Berridin: Yeah.\n[01:06:30] Berridin: What kind of range do you have in your...\n[01:06:30] Nyx: want to have one more ten okay all right and i want the color to be darker i'm happy with\n[01:06:33] Berridin: In your hot air balloons in terms of the sizes that we can get?\n[01:06:42] GM: Hieroterra uh they're made to order to our clientele's uh preference i mean i wouldn't i wouldn't go\n[01:06:48] Berridin: What kind of upper limit are we talking about here in terms of transportation?\n[01:06:55] GM: beyond 10 really uh given these models uh you know they're they can't quite go beyond that about\n[01:07:03] GM: 10 humans that's kind of the upper limit okay okay\n[01:07:07] Berridin: I think 10 is a reasonable number.\n[01:07:08] Berridin: We should just aim for the largest that we can possibly have, if that's not...\n[01:07:15] Nyx: find the purple\n[01:07:16] Nyx: but i want it real dark they're one of you\n[01:07:17] Berridin: You guys are really obsessed with the color of this thing.\n[01:07:19] GM: so um the indigo but darker dye that's fine we can work with um the tanneries with that 10 people\n[01:07:28] GM: anything else well hot air balloons uh current uh as the function is the gas with inside the balloon\n[01:07:30] Berridin: Yeah.\n[01:07:31] Berridin: Propulsion.\n[01:07:32] Berridin: Can you explain how propulsion works in this system?\n[01:07:43] GM: is heated uh is used to create flame to heat it and it rises um that's pretty much all the\n[01:07:50] GM: propulsion it is you go up the wind takes you when you want to go down you go up the wind takes you\n[01:07:54] GM: down you stop the heat you slowly come down um we can use some weights and balances also to help\n[01:08:00] GM: control that but you're at the mercy of the wind uh you could like i would you would be able to\n[01:08:04] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: Being a, sorry, I was just going to say being a gas alchemist or scientist in general, would I have like some knowledge of weather patterns to be able to like share?\n[01:08:23] GM: well here's the thing weather patterns in so much like i you would be able to i don't know how much\n[01:08:32] GM: you would know of the weather patterns here of an area you've never visited you could probably\n[01:08:38] GM: read up on documents and that above those weather patterns\n[01:08:38] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: I was more thinking of just the idea that, you know, wind moves in different directions at different heights.\n[01:08:49] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: So.\n[01:08:49] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: if you know the wind's not with us at one height we just have to go higher and it'll take us in\n[01:08:56] GM: yeah i would i would say like you would have enough and like it would depend on whatever\n[01:08:56] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: the right direction yeah how much of a deposit do we need to put down have you made any for a\n[01:09:03] GM: future role we do uh you would have enough wherewithal to be like oh okay yeah like the\n[01:09:09] GM: basic fundamentals like i thought you meant more more like a direct but basic fundamentals of like\n[01:09:14] GM: yeah we can lower go up or down depending on what the wind currents are and such you'd be able to do\n[01:09:21] GM: that um or you have a hindenburg well\n[01:09:23] Berridin: It feels like you're going to get better and better throughout.\n[01:09:28] Berridin: Okay.\n[01:09:35] Nyx: so\n[01:09:39] Nyx: forgive me if i say something stupid i don't know very much about this um is there any way to\n[01:09:48] Nyx: have forward propulsion instead of hi-firing i don't know\n[01:09:51] Nyx: have just up only up is there any technology that are there any airship hot air equivalent\n[01:09:53] GM: these are these are merely leisure vehicles uh used by some nobilities it's really for some\n[01:10:02] GM: casual kind of exploration well not even exploration um so really we haven't had any\n[01:10:10] GM: demands for any propulsion or whatever um but any kind of research into that that would be novel so\n[01:10:16] GM: there would be heavy expenses around it up sold so easily oh\n[01:10:21] Berridin: Interesting.\n[01:10:22] Berridin: Fascinating.\n[01:10:28] Nyx: maybe a different sort of air vehicle because we do need to explore and that is no no just\n[01:10:34] Nyx: fit for purpose and\n[01:10:35] Berridin: Yeah.\n[01:10:36] Nyx: i'm getting an airship\n[01:10:40] Ellara: Perhaps, you know,\n[01:10:41] Ellara: more cylindrical\n[01:10:42] Ellara: can go up in flames\n[01:10:43] Ysidor: Oh.\n[01:10:44] Ellara: when triggered.\n[01:10:45] Ellara: Or perhaps\n[01:10:46] Ellara: something like a bird.\n[01:10:48] Ellara: Like a bird,\n[01:10:48] Nyx: i see well no we should go with something more tried and true\n[01:10:49] Ellara: but with rigid wings.\n[01:10:50] Ellara: I'm just bitballing here.\n[01:10:54] GM: oh uh you want a personal airship hmm well we haven't made an airship before but what's your\n[01:11:02] GM: budget um i i'm sure you have a few thousand golds for this oh i have an airship it's gonna be like\n[01:11:04] Ysidor: One million.\n[01:11:10] Ysidor: Mm-hmm.\n[01:11:16] GM: well for um generally we want a 20 deposit um most projects take depending on the size if you\n[01:11:17] Nyx: it's not happening\n[01:11:18] Nyx: damn it no i don't care yeah it's fine no i color is not and we're not going to spend any\n[01:11:30] GM: go for an airship this will be several months and 20 of that and then you have a personal airship\n[01:11:34] GM: um for a hot air balloon it'll take several weeks again 20 percent um at the current 10 seater\n[01:11:40] GM: with the colors everything um i would say about in the ballpark about 200 golds any propulsion\n[01:11:49] GM: research will have to do um and with retrofitting and that that's an extra 50 to 100 gold depending\n[01:11:55] GM: on how we solution it but that would add several weeks to development four weeks um we are a bespoke\n[01:12:00] Berridin: What's the fastest that we can get a hot air balloon out of here?\n[01:12:08] Berridin: Four?\n[01:12:09] Berridin: You can't have any of these, like, pre-made hot air balloons?\n[01:12:16] GM: um there's not enough demand to create these on mass plus we have other clients we must serve\n[01:12:22] GM: before you roll a uh roll a luck check one to five i'll say yes uh roll a d100\n[01:12:28] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: client recently that happened to be purple where do i find luck uh d164 well what about what about\n[01:12:49] Ellara: Just roll a D1.\n[01:12:50] GM: sorry yeah i should have just said a d20 because of what but yeah anyways roll a d a 64 no\n[01:12:56] Berridin: Okay.\n[01:13:01] Berridin: It's okay.\n[01:13:06] GM: no we uh have not that's very peculiar um as i mentioned purple is a rather more expensive die\n[01:13:12] GM: um yes it seems it seems you all are in disagreement in what you need so feel free\n[01:13:14] Berridin: You guys got to drop the purple thing.\n[01:13:19] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: like lilac lavender okay i'm willing to drop the purple if we can make it happen i can buy some\n[01:13:21] Ysidor: Purple's a hard color, in general.\n[01:13:22] Berridin: No, what are...\n[01:13:23] Ysidor: For that amount of money, they should, in fact.\n[01:13:25] Nyx: more time i turn to Berridin and i try to\n[01:13:28] Nyx: i'm\n[01:13:29] Nyx: sorry can i speak to my my friends here in in just can we just have a moment to discuss yes\n[01:13:38] Nyx: thank you right thank you i turned to Berridin and and and i just looked and went and i'm just like\n[01:13:40] GM: um as i mentioned we do have prior clients so we will prioritize you unless you know\n[01:13:46] GM: you're willing to spend a lot of money oh no it's four weeks it's four weeks period\n[01:13:57] Nyx: guys this is gonna take four weeks to get built regardless of the color and if again remind me\n[01:14:05] Berridin: They can expedite it, or we can just grab, like, another one of the existing ones.\n[01:14:12] Nyx: if we take a carriage how long will it take guys guys the air is not it's it's it's\n[01:14:14] Berridin: Yeah.\n[01:14:17] Berridin: Two weeks.\n[01:14:20] Ellara: Lara just goes\n[01:14:21] Ellara: very nervously.\n[01:14:22] Ellara: See, I think this is a sign\n[01:14:24] Ellara: that we were not meant\n[01:14:25] Ellara: to go in the air.\n[01:14:29] Nyx: you're doing a real bad job pitching me on it no no no no Berridin and Berridin\n[01:14:31] Berridin: Why don't we put, like, a deposit down, and then when we come back, we'll have an airship ready.\n[01:14:37] Berridin: But then, in the meantime, we can ask them for, like, a loaner vehicle.\n[01:14:41] Berridin: Like, air balloon.\n[01:14:44] Berridin: I think it would make a lot of sense.\n[01:14:45] Berridin: No, you got to think about the future.\n[01:14:46] Berridin: You got to think about the future here.\n[01:14:46] Nyx: Berridin and Berridin it's four weeks it doesn't bear guys guys this is a non-starter\n[01:14:48] Berridin: Just envision it.\n[01:14:49] Berridin: Picture it.\n[01:14:50] Berridin: Picture it.\n[01:14:50] Berridin: No, we can...\n[01:14:55] Ellara: Whoa.\n[01:14:55] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: paint well okay how that was for purple well have have you sold any have you sold just any hot air\n[01:15:00] Nyx: four weeks by the time it's ready did they say how much no it's four weeks period that's the\n[01:15:01] Berridin: No, we...\n[01:15:02] Berridin: That was only...\n[01:15:03] Berridin: That was only the ones that are for purple.\n[01:15:06] Berridin: Yeah, that was the only ones that are...\n[01:15:08] Berridin: They might have it.\n[01:15:09] Berridin: They might have it already.\n[01:15:09] Ellara: No, no.\n[01:15:09] Ellara: Four weeks is just\n[01:15:10] Ellara: the minimum.\n[01:15:12] GM: minimum\n[01:15:13] Nyx: fastest yeah okay i know what you're thinking no no anyways you go there's like a 50 chance\n[01:15:15] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: balloons recently to anybody in town okay excuse us one second um so can we steal someone's hot\n[01:15:19] GM: we have um but uh i'm afraid the details of the clientele are privileged wait wait wait an airship\n[01:15:34] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: air balloon what what if next i feel like you're being\n[01:15:40] Nyx: that that damn thing's in the air right so look totally making up that number but um\n[01:15:47] Nyx: look it's not\n[01:15:50] Nyx: i'm sorry to say i know you're hell-bent on the air balloon but this is not gonna work\n[01:15:56] Nyx: unless there's something that i didn't hear that i didn't see that i'm missing\n[01:16:04] Nyx: even if if we do this there's gonna be so so at the very least soldiers\n[01:16:12] Nyx: at Meri at the village by the time we get that the balloon is constructed i don't mean like hey\n[01:16:21] Nyx: we're almost there i mean we're almost there we're almost there we're almost there we're almost there\n[01:16:23] Nyx: we haven't even lifted off yet and the soldiers are already not talking about the Warforged Constructs but\n[01:16:28] Nyx: they're on their way this is not working the math ain't mathin i'm sorry i will pay the rest of that\n[01:16:39] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: a little cheap here um you know we should we should really be uh you know gracious and helpful\n[01:16:47] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: to each other um what if you put down a deposit for an airship and we'll go take a different route\n[01:16:55] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: we'll take a carriage to Meri and can we have the airship when it's ready delivered to us\n[01:17:02] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: in in Ysidor's village and we'll pay the rest of that money when on delivery\n[01:17:03] Berridin: Yeah, I like that.\n[01:17:13] Nyx: money on delivery you can hear the eye roll the anger it's just like for the first time\n[01:17:15] Berridin: We'll discuss right yet.\n[01:17:17] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: oh i'm so glad i'm glad you agree\n[01:17:20] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: yeah we're parrot sailing i have a carriage we don't have horses\n[01:17:21] Berridin: Amazing.\n[01:17:31] Nyx: for the first time Nyx is actually getting like irritated\n[01:17:36] Nyx: no no no they met an air yeah i know air it's a hot air balloon like that's the thing right and\n[01:17:38] GM: you want an airship several thousand gold you hear a little voice being like we don't do delivery\n[01:17:47] Nyx: Nyx says it he goes look yeah like i don't understand the benefit of the air\n[01:17:54] GM: is that\n[01:18:02] Nyx: balloon you have not sold me on that at this point with all the things that have we've heard\n[01:18:05] Berridin: How...\n[01:18:07] Nyx: there is no reason to get this balloon i spin around fascinating\n[01:18:10] Ellara: Have you heard\n[01:18:10] Ellara: of a bird that's not in the air?\n[01:18:11] Ellara: Of hype moments\n[01:18:12] Ellara: and aura.\n[01:18:16] Ysidor: I think we should connect carriages to other carriages\n[01:18:18] Ysidor: and have them pulled by a central horse on a track.\n[01:18:21] Berridin: Yeah, I like that.\n[01:18:24] Berridin: I like that.\n[01:18:25] Berridin: Can I...\n[01:18:25] Nyx: yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it's gonna have it's gonna have harpoons\n[01:18:26] Berridin: Can we ask the dwarf guy?\n[01:18:30] Ysidor: Wow.\n[01:18:31] Berridin: I have two questions.\n[01:18:31] Ysidor: That's worth five.\n[01:18:34] Berridin: I have two questions.\n[01:18:34] Berridin: Do you have a hot air balloon that is available now that can be pulled via horses near the ground?\n[01:18:47] Berridin: Like, kind of like a carriage air balloon?\n[01:18:52] Ysidor: We're doing jet skiing, but, like, on the ground.\n[01:18:55] GM: you so you you see the dwarf looks at you and it's like so you want to\n[01:18:55] Berridin: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n[01:18:56] Berridin: Yeah, it's like paragliding.\n[01:18:56] Ellara: I feel like this dwarf is like,\n[01:18:56] Ysidor: Like, what?\n[01:18:59] Ysidor: Paragraph.\n[01:19:00] Berridin: Yeah.\n[01:19:00] Ysidor: Paragraph.\n[01:19:04] GM: buy it but you don't want to pay a lot of money and you're like oh i have to go with it\n[01:19:06] Berridin: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n[01:19:07] GM: so i'm just going to stand in the back line to help you out so i'm just gonna draw a line\n[01:19:11] GM: on the main line ok so it's the almost the most expensive draw how much is it\n[01:19:17] GM: yeah it's just a bunch of straws and it's a bunch of gold you can't get a lot of money\n[01:19:21] GM: yeah well that's kind of one of the reasons why you're wasting money on the first place\n[01:19:24] GM: is because that's the other thing that's going to make you pocket money like too much money\n[01:19:28] GM: okay we don't sell stuff on the first place so it's that problem we're running at it's like we're\n[01:19:31] GM: trying to really sell stuff to the clientele right so if you're going to be a d100 or something like that\n[01:19:32] GM: we're not selling the stuff that you're going to have but we're looking at like what is it we're sea of this\n[01:19:33] GM: and while I understand there might be a peel\n[01:19:35] GM: of a floating carriage\n[01:19:36] GM: which potentially\n[01:19:37] Berridin: Yeah.\n[01:19:38] GM: tires the beast a little less\n[01:19:38] Berridin: We care about our animals.\n[01:19:41] GM: we do not have such\n[01:19:47] GM: a thing and again\n[01:19:49] GM: bespoke we make\n[01:19:51] Berridin: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.\n[01:19:52] Berridin: And then...\n[01:19:53] GM: to order\n[01:19:53] GM: the light have mercy\n[01:19:54] Berridin: The last question I'd like to ask is, if we get a...\n[01:19:58] Berridin: If we get, like, a simple air balloon, can it be upgraded in the future?\n[01:20:10] Berridin: Like, is it like a modular system that we could upgrade?\n[01:20:15] Ysidor: Like, what are we upgrading?\n[01:20:16] Ellara: have you ever seen\n[01:20:17] Ellara: a hot air balloon in your life?\n[01:20:18] Berridin: Yeah.\n[01:20:20] Berridin: Okay, I'm just asking, okay?\n[01:20:23] Ellara: You know,\n[01:20:23] Berridin: I'm asking the dwarf.\n[01:20:23] Ellara: you get a fancier basket.\n[01:20:24] GM: the light have\n[01:20:25] GM: mercy on me\n[01:20:25] Ellara: You get a fancier basket.\n[01:20:26] Nyx: i Nyx looks and and just looks at her and just and looks at them and just says\n[01:20:27] GM: we are not\n[01:20:30] GM: responsible for any\n[01:20:31] GM: post sales\n[01:20:33] GM: modification should you\n[01:20:35] GM: desire any post sales modification\n[01:20:37] GM: this will enter a new contract\n[01:20:39] GM: and that will be discussed at that moment\n[01:20:41] GM: I am not at the liberty\n[01:20:43] Berridin: Amazing.\n[01:20:43] Berridin: So you're saying that it hasn't ever...\n[01:20:44] Ysidor: Bobby took out his corporate voice.\n[01:20:46] Berridin: It hasn't ever been discussed before?\n[01:20:50] Berridin: Come on.\n[01:20:52] GM: to disclose any\n[01:20:53] GM: of the previous sales that we've had\n[01:20:56] GM: with other clients\n[01:20:58] GM: sir\n[01:21:00] Berridin: What is, like, your most exciting hot air balloon tech that's coming up in the future?\n[01:21:12] Berridin: I'm sure you could share something with us.\n[01:21:16] Berridin: Anything cool?\n[01:21:18] Berridin: And I can roll if I...\n[01:21:19] GM: we are not the Duskbreaker Lighthouse\n[01:21:21] Berridin: If that would

Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: oh oh Ellara do you do you know of like does the do the Eulogians have\n[01:25:16] Berridin: We follow.\n[01:25:17] Berridin: It's weird.\n[01:25:30] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: any uh stables that we could uh you know\n[01:25:34] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: it's a really nice carriage i have a really nice carriage\n[01:25:35] Ellara: well,\n[01:25:36] Ellara: and they do,\n[01:25:36] Ellara: but we have rented\n[01:25:37] Ellara: a carriage before.\n[01:25:39] Ellara: We could just go back to them.\n[01:25:44] Ellara: We had rented one\n[01:25:45] Ellara: to go to the village.\n[01:25:46] Ellara: Right?\n[01:25:46] Ellara: Or catch up to\n[01:25:48] Ellara: Meri before.\n[01:25:49] GM: you have\n[01:25:50] GM: wait\n[01:25:51] GM: as you can return an even in return your better fairly do you've been military inspection with us are we going under extremism legal慈\n[01:25:52] Ellara: We had some horse.\n[01:25:53] GM: had rented a carriage yeah yeah you did rent a carriage with that aborted uh original plan\n[01:25:54] Ellara: We just returned it.\n[01:25:55] Ellara: We returned it after like a day\n[01:25:57] Ellara: and the guy was like,\n[01:25:57] Ellara: what the fuck?\n[01:26:04] GM: um so yeah that was on the eastern side you could in theory there uh or you just yeah get a carriage\n[01:26:09] Nyx: okay why don't we just get horses i'd rather just have horses at this point\n[01:26:13] Ellara: Yeah, we could just...\n[01:26:15] Ellara: Yeah, or we could just\n[01:26:16] Ellara: rent horses from them\n[01:26:17] Ellara: because I think we had to\n[01:26:18] Ellara: choose some horses too.\n[01:26:20] Ellara: So we could just\n[01:26:20] Ellara: rent the horses\n[01:26:21] Ellara: if we have a carriage.\n[01:26:25] Nyx: can we all ride we'd have to bring an extra well no i can ride i can definitely ride\n[01:26:28] Ellara: I can't.\n[01:26:29] Ysidor: I'm a student.\n[01:26:31] Ysidor: I'm pretty sure I can.\n[01:26:33] Ysidor: Nyx is probably the least likely to be able to ride.\n[01:26:37] Ellara: No, I have been around.\n[01:26:37] Ysidor: Nyx or Berridin.\n[01:26:40] Ellara: Berridin maybe not.\n[01:26:41] Ellara: He's a city dude.\n[01:26:42] Ysidor: Yeah.\n[01:26:43] Ysidor: Berridin will ride with me.\n[01:26:44] Ysidor: It's fine.\n[01:26:45] Nyx: yeah well i'm worried about Meri regardless depending on what we need to do\n[01:26:45] Ysidor: It's fine.\n[01:26:52] Nyx: it's good to and oh and what about carrying our stuff i guess we just carry it on our backs\n[01:26:57] Nyx: saddlebags yeah yeah all right let's do the carriage and fewer horses okay where do we go\n[01:26:58] Ellara: I mean, that's what\n[01:26:59] Ellara: the carriage is.\n[01:26:59] Ellara: That's what the carriage is for.\n[01:27:03] GM: and less horses yeah if you want to go that the horse well i assume Whitaker's carriage is in the\n[01:27:05] Ysidor: No, that doesn't sound right.\n[01:27:06] Ysidor: I actually could.\n[01:27:08] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: and so instead of making two trips uh Ysidor you look like a strong fellow would you be\n[01:27:18] Nyx: i think Nyx would know right we can no that's gonna be suspicious\n[01:27:26] GM: west side the horses are in the east side where you got the horses last time\n[01:27:35] GM: and what's going on with the carriage\n[01:27:44] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: interested in pulling the carriage to the east side it just seems like a really long way for\n[01:27:57] Ysidor: I think I actually physically can, too.\n[01:27:59] Ysidor: That's the worst part.\n[01:28:02] Nyx: what's your oh my god\n[01:28:02] Ysidor: Let me see one second.\n[01:28:03] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: me to walk i've been walking a lot the last few days and i've been walking a lot for a long time\n[01:28:06] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: wouldn't mind a little seat in the carriage while you know um yeah exactly um at this point with\n[01:28:10] Berridin: Like a rickshaw?\n[01:28:15] Berridin: Okay, yeah.\n[01:28:15] Ysidor: Can I just...\n[01:28:16] Berridin: Yeah.\n[01:28:17] Berridin: Yeah, why don't...\n[01:28:17] Ysidor: I go, oh, if you don't want to walk, that's no problem.\n[01:28:21] Ysidor: And I just pick him up and put him on my shoulder\n[01:28:23] Ysidor: the same way I would do a Berridin.\n[01:28:25] Nyx: yeah all right let's do it we know no we have a carriage right yeah it's Berridin i mean it's it's\n[01:28:29] Ysidor: Let's go rent a carriage now.\n[01:28:34] Ellara: So we're renting a carriage\n[01:28:35] Ellara: or are we renting?\n[01:28:36] Ysidor: Oh, horses.\n[01:28:37] Ellara: Yeah.\n[01:28:37] Ysidor: Sorry.\n[01:28:38] Ysidor: Sorry, horses.\n[01:28:39] Ysidor: Yeah.\n[01:28:41] Ellara: Lara will ask.\n[01:28:42] GM: yeah\n[01:28:43] Ellara: I mean,\n[01:28:45] Nyx: it's Whitaker right\n[01:28:48] Berridin: Why don't...\n[01:28:48] Berridin: Why don't...\n[01:28:49] Ellara: I mean, we can rent the horses\n[01:28:50] Berridin: Yeah.\n[01:28:50] Ellara: and then\n[01:28:50] Ellara: take a horse,\n[01:28:51] Ysidor: Yeah, bring the horses.\n[01:28:51] GM: well\n[01:28:51] Ysidor: It seems weird that you can rent...\n[01:28:52] Berridin: Yeah.\n[01:28:52] Ellara: take the horses there.\n[01:28:53] Berridin: Okay.\n[01:28:55] Ellara: But Ellara's going to ask,\n[01:28:56] Ellara: when are we planning\n[01:28:57] Ellara: on leaving\n[01:28:57] Ysidor: Mm-hmm.\n[01:28:58] Ellara: now?\n[01:29:02] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: like oh sorry at this point with like uh talking and stuff it's getting kind of loud around me\n[01:29:06] Whitaker \"Witty\" Whitman VI: so maybe while you all go get some horses i can just go

Ellara: that she grabbed.\n[01:31:32] Ellara: I don't know what.\n[01:31:34] Ellara: Creates eyes on the nature\n[01:31:35] Ellara: of the difference\n[01:31:37] Ellara: between different

been\n[01:31:44] Ellara: very supportive\n[01:31:44] Ellara: about this issue.\n[01:31:46] Ellara: And I know you are\n[01:31:47] GM: yes no i understand and i will give you updates um i will it will be sad not to see you here um\n[01:31:47] Ellara: working through it\n[01:31:47] Ellara: with the correct channels\n[01:31:49] Ellara: but sometimes,\n[01:31:50] Ellara: as you mentioned,\n[01:31:51] Ellara: they are really slow.\n[01:32:01] GM: you do add a lot to the seminary but i understand the calling\n[01:32:06] GM: that you must be hearing so yes go forth you have my blessing\n[01:32:10]

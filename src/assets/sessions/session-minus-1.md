## Session -1: Initial world building and general framework discussions

**Date:** April 6, 2025
**Location:** Online Session

This initial session focused on setting hopes, dreams, and expectations. We discussed the world's themes, potential character concepts, and established narrative boundaries for our campaign.

### Key Decisions:
- Established our world as a Steampunk/Gaslamp Fantasy setting where magic and emerging technology exist in societal tension
- Explored the possibility of an overarching church structure reminiscent of Catholicism, influencing the world's spiritual and political landscape
- Discussed how our world's society is stratified between nobles and commoners, creating opportunities for diverse character backgrounds
- Shared initial character concepts and considered how each might fit into different societal niches
- Had conversations about narrative boundaries and player comfort zones
- Contemplated whether characters will have pre-existing connections when our adventure begins

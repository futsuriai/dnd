[00:00:00 -> 00:00:02]  Okay, yes. That's true. So Alara has met
[00:00:02 -> 00:00:04]  Witty. You haven't met the siblings, so
[00:00:04 -> 00:00:06]  Alara, you would be able to
[00:00:06 -> 00:00:07]  clock someone you know there.
[00:00:08 -> 00:00:10]  Otherwise, you don't know where the rest of your party
[00:00:10 -> 00:00:10]  is.
[00:00:12 -> 00:00:14]  And just for a reminder,
[00:00:14 -> 00:00:16]  Isidore and
[00:00:16 -> 00:00:17]  Witty both don't have sending stones.
[00:00:19 -> 00:00:20]  Gotta solve that.
[00:00:23 -> 00:00:24]  But, just
[00:00:24 -> 00:00:25]  as a reminder, so now
[00:00:25 -> 00:00:27]  you are inside the Grand
[00:00:27 -> 00:00:30]  Ducal Palace at this party.
[00:00:30 -> 00:00:32]  There are numerous
[00:00:32 -> 00:00:34]  figures. You see
[00:00:34 -> 00:00:36]  no shadowed. Even the servants are
[00:00:36 -> 00:00:38]  not shadowed,
[00:00:38 -> 00:00:38]  folks.
[00:00:41 -> 00:00:42]  They're
[00:00:42 -> 00:00:44]  walking among a
[00:00:44 -> 00:00:46]  variety of, you see,
[00:00:46 -> 00:00:48]  both traditional kind of more
[00:00:48 -> 00:00:50]  aristocrats, but also wealthy
[00:00:50 -> 00:00:51]  merchants in that.
[00:00:52 -> 00:00:54]  Maybe some familiar
[00:00:54 -> 00:00:56]  faces from the Golden Dove, perhaps.
[00:00:57 -> 00:01:00]  But yeah, so
[00:01:00 -> 00:01:03]  what does the party do?
[00:01:03 -> 00:01:07]  We had just introduced
[00:01:07 -> 00:01:08]  ourselves, right?
[00:01:08 -> 00:01:11]  Yes, and you were just, yeah, you introduced
[00:01:11 -> 00:01:13]  yourself, kind of got, like, they went on
[00:01:13 -> 00:01:14]  to speak to other people.
[00:01:15 -> 00:01:17]  Can you remind me what the big, like,
[00:01:17 -> 00:01:19]  last twist in the conversation
[00:01:19 -> 00:01:21]  was at the end of that one?
[00:01:22 -> 00:01:23]  There wasn't so
[00:01:23 -> 00:01:25]  much of a twist, as in just
[00:01:25 -> 00:01:26]  you were introduced.
[00:01:27 -> 00:01:29]  Donathan kind of made some remarks.
[00:01:30 -> 00:01:31]  I don't think anything's going to happen.
[00:01:31 -> 00:01:33]  Anything of significance. A little surprised
[00:01:33 -> 00:01:34]  that the other siblings were here
[00:01:34 -> 00:01:35]  to support you.
[00:01:37 -> 00:01:38]  Made a comment
[00:01:38 -> 00:01:41]  about, was it the third sibling?
[00:01:41 -> 00:01:43]  I think it's the third sibling that's the one
[00:01:43 -> 00:01:44]  from the party.
[00:01:44 -> 00:01:46]  I just showed your face.
[00:01:47 -> 00:01:48]  Din?
[00:01:49 -> 00:01:49]  Yeah.
[00:01:49 -> 00:01:51]  The third sibling?
[00:01:51 -> 00:01:54]  Yeah, kind of implied, knew about what the scandal
[00:01:54 -> 00:01:57]  was about, something inappropriate
[00:01:57 -> 00:01:57]  with
[00:01:57 -> 00:02:00]  a daughter of another
[00:02:00 -> 00:02:00]  family.
[00:02:01 -> 00:02:04]  Seemed to imply
[00:02:04 -> 00:02:05]  Donathan was aware, well,
[00:02:06 -> 00:02:07]  either through the gossip or
[00:02:07 -> 00:02:09]  maybe around, who knows, with
[00:02:09 -> 00:02:10]  this guy,
[00:02:11 -> 00:02:13]  was aware of a bit of the scandal.
[00:02:15 -> 00:02:17]  Given you're from the same area,
[00:02:17 -> 00:02:19]  your families would have walked the same circles
[00:02:19 -> 00:02:26]  kind of thing. That was kind of
[00:02:26 -> 00:02:27]  it. Like, Donathan's like, oh.
[00:02:31 -> 00:02:32]  So wait, so
[00:02:32 -> 00:02:34]  obvious, Din is
[00:02:34 -> 00:02:34]  three.
[00:02:35 -> 00:02:38]  Um, four
[00:02:38 -> 00:02:40]  is rugged camp person.
[00:02:40 -> 00:02:41]  Me.
[00:02:41 -> 00:02:43]  And that's
[00:02:43 -> 00:02:45]  Nick's. And so Ysidor is
[00:02:45 -> 00:02:46]  the priestly one.
[00:02:47 -> 00:02:49]  Oh, yeah, yeah, that's true.
[00:02:50 -> 00:02:51]  Okay, okay.
[00:02:51 -> 00:02:52]  Just wanted to remember.
[00:02:53 -> 00:02:54]  Just wanted to remember because
[00:02:54 -> 00:02:57]  um, yeah, so
[00:02:57 -> 00:02:59]  you're all kind of in this
[00:02:59 -> 00:03:00]  grand ball.
[00:03:01 -> 00:03:03]  Alara, I would say
[00:03:03 -> 00:03:04]  um,
[00:03:05 -> 00:03:07]  Proctor Edwards kind of sticking
[00:03:07 -> 00:03:09]  with you. He's done rounds
[00:03:09 -> 00:03:11]  introducing you to various
[00:03:11 -> 00:03:13]  folks kind of
[00:03:13 -> 00:03:15]  around. Um,
[00:03:15 -> 00:03:16]  but like very much kind of
[00:03:16 -> 00:03:19]  doing schmoozing kind
[00:03:19 -> 00:03:20]  of thing. Right.
[00:03:23 -> 00:03:24]  Um, so
[00:03:24 -> 00:03:36]  I'm gonna go dance. So I'll see you guys
[00:03:36 -> 00:03:40]  later. Are you
[00:03:40 -> 00:03:42]  dancing with anyone or
[00:03:42 -> 00:03:44]  I'll say this. Let's go a little like
[00:03:44 -> 00:03:46]  there's kind of
[00:03:46 -> 00:03:48]  a la Bridgerton or like any
[00:03:48 -> 00:03:50]  of the show in like the middle. There's
[00:03:50 -> 00:03:52]  kind of like a group flocking
[00:03:52 -> 00:03:54]  dancing. People are interchanging
[00:03:54 -> 00:03:55]  partners.
[00:03:56 -> 00:03:58]  Oh, um,
[00:03:58 -> 00:04:00]  like, like, you know,
[00:04:00 -> 00:04:02]  kind of like there's a very like aristocratic
[00:04:02 -> 00:04:04]  like people learn all these dances
[00:04:04 -> 00:04:06]  like growing up. There's
[00:04:06 -> 00:04:08]  like music. You change partners move
[00:04:08 -> 00:04:10]  around. It's very like highly
[00:04:10 -> 00:04:12]  coordinated. Um,
[00:04:12 -> 00:04:15]  what do you want to roll for
[00:04:15 -> 00:04:17]  this? I want to see how good you dance.
[00:04:18 -> 00:04:18]  Yeah.
[00:04:18 -> 00:04:18]  Uh,
[00:04:20 -> 00:04:21]  I, I, I
[00:04:21 -> 00:04:24]  probably, you know,
[00:04:25 -> 00:04:26]  I'd say yeah,
[00:04:26 -> 00:04:28]  yeah, probably, probably performance.
[00:04:28 -> 00:04:30]  I'd say, yeah,
[00:04:31 -> 00:04:32]  just, uh, I need to make
[00:04:32 -> 00:04:34]  sure I have that open so I can actually
[00:04:34 -> 00:04:39]  that was a natural one.
[00:04:39 -> 00:04:40]  Woof.
[00:04:41 -> 00:04:41]  Yeah.
[00:04:42 -> 00:04:45]  So, um, I will say
[00:04:45 -> 00:04:46]  I'll say
[00:04:46 -> 00:04:48]  witty like you joined the dance.
[00:04:48 -> 00:04:50]  You're running into the,
[00:04:50 -> 00:04:53]  uh, the other gentlemen beside
[00:04:53 -> 00:04:55]  you stepping on your partner's feet
[00:04:55 -> 00:04:55]  like it.
[00:04:57 -> 00:04:58]  It's not going well.
[00:04:58 -> 00:05:00]  Um, but like, I, I wonder
[00:05:00 -> 00:05:02]  witty, how do you take that?
[00:05:02 -> 00:05:04]  Are you just going still going with it
[00:05:04 -> 00:05:06]  or just like, yeah,
[00:05:06 -> 00:05:08]  rule rules have
[00:05:08 -> 00:05:10]  never really, you know,
[00:05:10 -> 00:05:11]  uh,
[00:05:12 -> 00:05:14]  mattered to witty in the dances.
[00:05:14 -> 00:05:16]  You know, he just, he's going with what he
[00:05:16 -> 00:05:18]  feels in his heart and he's pretty much
[00:05:18 -> 00:05:20]  unaware of the
[00:05:20 -> 00:05:21]  what he's doing to the bumbling, sir.
[00:05:21 -> 00:05:24]  Yeah, he's just having a good time and
[00:05:24 -> 00:05:26]  you know, that's what he's, that's what
[00:05:26 -> 00:05:26]  he's worried about.
[00:05:29 -> 00:05:29]  Valid.
[00:05:31 -> 00:05:33]  And what about everyone else?
[00:05:33 -> 00:05:34]  Um,
[00:05:35 -> 00:05:38]  you know, uh, the, uh,
[00:05:38 -> 00:05:40]  the wit takers three through five.
[00:05:41 -> 00:05:41]  Yeah.
[00:05:41 -> 00:05:44]  So nature, nature boy
[00:05:44 -> 00:05:46]  is, um,
[00:05:47 -> 00:05:49]  staying a little bit like to the side,
[00:05:49 -> 00:05:51]  not partaking in the dance, just trying
[00:05:51 -> 00:05:53]  to be nixon's.
[00:05:53 -> 00:05:55]  Kind of playing the role.
[00:05:55 -> 00:05:57]  He's like by a column brooding.
[00:05:57 -> 00:05:59]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:05:59 -> 00:06:01]  Exactly.
[00:06:01 -> 00:06:03]  None of them know that
[00:06:03 -> 00:06:05]  I'm the, I'm the nature guy.
[00:06:05 -> 00:06:07]  Like what?
[00:06:07 -> 00:06:09]  I feel like
[00:06:09 -> 00:06:11]  the description of Aragon when you meet
[00:06:11 -> 00:06:13]  him at the end. That's exactly
[00:06:13 -> 00:06:15]  I'm really trying
[00:06:15 -> 00:06:17]  to do fellowship like that.
[00:06:17 -> 00:06:19]  Yeah.
[00:06:19 -> 00:06:21]  Exactly.
[00:06:21 -> 00:06:23]  You see, but in
[00:06:23 -> 00:06:35]  so that's what I'm doing.
[00:06:35 -> 00:06:37]  Really, really pushing that.
[00:06:37 -> 00:06:39]  Um, yeah.
[00:06:39 -> 00:06:41]  And hoping no one
[00:06:41 -> 00:06:43]  says anything.
[00:06:43 -> 00:06:45]  I thought, I thought number
[00:06:45 -> 00:06:47]  three was the brooder.
[00:06:47 -> 00:06:49]  No, number three was number three is the one
[00:06:49 -> 00:06:51]  we know nothing about that like
[00:06:51 -> 00:06:53]  was like for the family
[00:06:53 -> 00:06:55]  and like disappeared
[00:06:55 -> 00:06:57]  from society.
[00:06:57 -> 00:06:59]  I got to change up my mentality then.
[00:06:59 -> 00:07:01]  Oh wait.
[00:07:01 -> 00:07:03]  Artur has a visit. Oh.
[00:07:03 -> 00:07:05]  Oh my God.
[00:07:05 -> 00:07:07]  He's like 20 pounds.
[00:07:07 -> 00:07:09]  Oh my goodness.
[00:07:09 -> 00:07:11]  Look at this.
[00:07:11 -> 00:07:13]  Oh my God.
[00:07:13 -> 00:07:15]  He's upset.
[00:07:15 -> 00:07:17]  He needs to poop.
[00:07:17 -> 00:07:19]  Love you.
[00:07:19 -> 00:07:21]  I didn't, I meant to ask,
[00:07:21 -> 00:07:23]  did you guys get a lot of snow?
[00:07:23 -> 00:07:25]  I missed the beginning of the conversation.
[00:07:25 -> 00:07:27]  Oh yeah.
[00:07:27 -> 00:07:30]  I did not.
[00:07:30 -> 00:07:32]  Did you get a lot of what, sorry?
[00:07:32 -> 00:07:34]  No, I heard smell. I was like what?
[00:07:34 -> 00:07:36]  The smell.
[00:07:36 -> 00:07:38]  Well.
[00:07:38 -> 00:07:40]  Well.
[00:07:40 -> 00:07:42]  Um, yeah, no, we actually
[00:07:42 -> 00:07:44]  have permanent snow like before Christmas
[00:07:44 -> 00:07:46]  which is like. You got perma-sprost.
[00:07:46 -> 00:07:48]  It's here. Okay.
[00:07:48 -> 00:07:50]  I always called it that.
[00:07:50 -> 00:07:52]  It's perma-frost.
[00:07:52 -> 00:07:54]  I mean.
[00:07:56 -> 00:07:58]  Part of the ground.
[00:07:58 -> 00:08:00]  Perma-frost is like tundra.
[00:08:00 -> 00:08:02]  Oh no, exactly, but like
[00:08:02 -> 00:08:04]  Avi, just so that you know. Yeah. The ground's just like.
[00:08:04 -> 00:08:06]  It's just frozen.
[00:08:06 -> 00:08:08]  Yeah, it's just frozen all the time.
[00:08:08 -> 00:08:10]  And so, yeah.
[00:08:10 -> 00:08:12]  That's not Montreal. We have agriculture.
[00:08:12 -> 00:08:14]  Oh gosh.
[00:08:14 -> 00:08:16]  I visited, I remember visiting Alex
[00:08:16 -> 00:08:18]  when I was doing college tours.
[00:08:18 -> 00:08:20]  Remember that Alex?
[00:08:20 -> 00:08:22]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:08:22 -> 00:08:24]  It was like years ago.
[00:08:24 -> 00:08:26]  Yeah.
[00:08:26 -> 00:08:28]  Like in Montreal?
[00:08:28 -> 00:08:30]  Yeah, at McGill.
[00:08:30 -> 00:08:32]  In what month?
[00:08:32 -> 00:08:34]  February?
[00:08:34 -> 00:08:36]  Yeah, I only know that and it turned me off
[00:08:36 -> 00:08:38]  immediately.
[00:08:38 -> 00:08:40]  You know how little it is?
[00:08:40 -> 00:08:42]  It's cold, like that's like half a year.
[00:08:42 -> 00:08:44]  I know, it's probably
[00:08:44 -> 00:08:46]  like a spring or something and it was
[00:08:46 -> 00:08:48]  freezing my butt off.
[00:08:48 -> 00:08:50]  It's like for work, sometimes
[00:08:50 -> 00:08:52]  like because our Canadian
[00:08:52 -> 00:08:54]  headquarters is in Montreal and they're like
[00:08:54 -> 00:08:56]  our American headquarters is in
[00:08:56 -> 00:08:58]  Arizona for comparison.
[00:08:58 -> 00:09:00]  Oh my god, yeah. And they're like, yeah, I went in
[00:09:00 -> 00:09:02]  February. I was like
[00:09:02 -> 00:09:04]  No.
[00:09:04 -> 00:09:06]  No.
[00:09:06 -> 00:09:08]  Like, we're not built for that.
[00:09:08 -> 00:09:10]  It's just cruel and unusual
[00:09:10 -> 00:09:12]  punishment.
[00:09:12 -> 00:09:14]  And like also by February
[00:09:14 -> 00:09:16]  most of the stuff's done, like fun
[00:09:16 -> 00:09:18]  stuff, so like Igloofest
[00:09:18 -> 00:09:20]  Yeah.
[00:09:20 -> 00:09:22]  Igloofest already happened.
[00:09:22 -> 00:09:24]  So it's like, no, we're
[00:09:24 -> 00:09:26]  just holding out till March.
[00:09:26 -> 00:09:28]  Oh my god.
[00:09:28 -> 00:09:30]  Yeah, basically imagine an outdoor rave.
[00:09:30 -> 00:09:32]  Okay, that sounds fun.
[00:09:32 -> 00:09:34]  Basically, yeah. And because we're really proud of it.
[00:09:34 -> 00:09:36]  It's a lot warmer. I never went.
[00:09:36 -> 00:09:38]  Mark went the first year we were dating and I was like
[00:09:38 -> 00:09:40]  This is crazy.
[00:09:40 -> 00:09:42]  Yeah, but point being like there's nothing
[00:09:42 -> 00:09:44]  fun to do in the city by that point.
[00:09:46 -> 00:09:48]  But yes, so
[00:09:48 -> 00:09:50]  okay, so we have Dark
[00:09:50 -> 00:09:52]  and Brooding.
[00:09:52 -> 00:09:54]  We have Witty having the time
[00:09:54 -> 00:09:56]  of his life just dancing.
[00:09:56 -> 00:09:58]  For now.
[00:09:58 -> 00:10:00]  Maybe getting dirty looks
[00:10:00 -> 00:10:02]  and not noticing at all.
[00:10:02 -> 00:10:04]  Brother number three and
[00:10:04 -> 00:10:06]  brother number five.
[00:10:06 -> 00:10:08]  Okay, I'm kind of like a
[00:10:08 -> 00:10:10]  Playboy character, right?
[00:10:10 -> 00:10:12]  Well,
[00:10:12 -> 00:10:14]  that's what it applies
[00:10:14 -> 00:10:16]  that what the scandal is,
[00:10:16 -> 00:10:18]  but no one really seen you in a long time.
[00:10:18 -> 00:10:20]  I was actually kind of like image
[00:10:20 -> 00:10:22]  like thinking of like a like a leering
[00:10:22 -> 00:10:24]  kind of like a emo
[00:10:24 -> 00:10:26]  guy, but I'm a
[00:10:26 -> 00:10:28]  I'm gonna kind of mix it.
[00:10:28 -> 00:10:30]  I would like to make a perception check
[00:10:30 -> 00:10:32]  to see if there is
[00:10:32 -> 00:10:34]  any
[00:10:34 -> 00:10:36]  interested ladies
[00:10:36 -> 00:10:38]  or men that are
[00:10:38 -> 00:10:42]  looking my way.

[00:11:02 -> 00:11:04]  like this will be
[00:11:04 -> 00:11:06]  Yeah.
[00:11:06 -> 00:11:08]  I will say with a five like
[00:11:08 -> 00:11:10]  then you're like taking
[00:11:10 -> 00:11:12]  on kind of what you
[00:11:12 -> 00:11:14]  imagine from witty's
[00:11:14 -> 00:11:16]  explanation. Yeah,
[00:11:16 -> 00:11:18]  the brother is and you're like
[00:11:18 -> 00:11:20]  I'm the hottest piece of shit here.
[00:11:20 -> 00:11:22]  This is the narrative.
[00:11:22 -> 00:11:24]  You're like everyone's interested.
[00:11:24 -> 00:11:26]  Oh, wow.
[00:11:26 -> 00:11:28]  Okay.
[00:11:28 -> 00:11:30]  I kind of like
[00:11:30 -> 00:11:32]  like like slow motion
[00:11:32 -> 00:11:34]  my hair. I have I'm imagining
[00:11:34 -> 00:11:36]  kind of long flowing
[00:11:36 -> 00:11:38]  what color hair does
[00:11:38 -> 00:11:40]  what do you have?
[00:11:40 -> 00:11:42]  Oh, no, they all have different hair colors, right?
[00:11:42 -> 00:11:44]  No.
[00:11:44 -> 00:11:46]  Different colors.
[00:11:46 -> 00:11:48]  But the hair I think he just dyed his hair.
[00:11:48 -> 00:11:50]  It's not that it's naturally that but you can
[00:11:50 -> 00:11:52]  you can go with that.
[00:11:52 -> 00:11:54]  Did I have purple hair?
[00:11:54 -> 00:11:56]  I know I have a purple suit.
[00:11:56 -> 00:11:58]  I don't know if you did.
[00:11:58 -> 00:12:00]  Orange?
[00:12:00 -> 00:12:02]  Okay.
[00:12:02 -> 00:12:04]  I kind of run my orange hair
[00:12:04 -> 00:12:06]  through as if I'm
[00:12:06 -> 00:12:08]  running one of my fingers through my orange hair
[00:12:08 -> 00:12:10]  as if I'm the shit
[00:12:10 -> 00:12:12]  and I walk
[00:12:12 -> 00:12:14]  over loudly to
[00:12:14 -> 00:12:16]  do I see any groups kind of
[00:12:16 -> 00:12:18]  chatting or anything?
[00:12:18 -> 00:12:20]  Well, yeah, there would be like
[00:12:20 -> 00:12:22]  small little pockets
[00:12:22 -> 00:12:24]  around
[00:12:24 -> 00:12:26]  like so in the center is the dancing
[00:12:26 -> 00:12:28]  where witty's
[00:12:28 -> 00:12:30]  having
[00:12:30 -> 00:12:32]  having the time of his life
[00:12:32 -> 00:12:34]  off on the side.
[00:12:34 -> 00:12:36]  Yeah, there's like one
[00:12:36 -> 00:12:38]  piece in 11.
[00:12:38 -> 00:12:40]  I'll say yeah, you see different groups.
[00:12:40 -> 00:12:42]  Some of them are
[00:12:42 -> 00:12:44]  like some are like
[00:12:44 -> 00:12:46]  men speaking to each other.
[00:12:46 -> 00:12:48]  Some are like women or
[00:12:48 -> 00:12:50]  are like all femme presenting.
[00:12:50 -> 00:12:52]  Some are more mixed just chatting along.
[00:12:54 -> 00:12:57]  You know, holding drinks
[00:12:57 -> 00:12:59]  taking little canapes as servers go by.
[00:12:59 -> 00:13:01]  Yeah, so there's multiple groups.
[00:13:05 -> 00:13:07]  Can I
[00:13:07 -> 00:13:09]  can I can I overhear anything
[00:13:09 -> 00:13:11]  I don't know.
[00:13:11 -> 00:13:13]  I would say
[00:13:13 -> 00:13:15]  that's interesting.
[00:13:15 -> 00:13:17]  Yeah, well, I wouldn't like it's
[00:13:17 -> 00:13:19]  there's not here.
[00:13:19 -> 00:13:21]  How would I put it? It's not like anything
[00:13:21 -> 00:13:23]  like
[00:13:23 -> 00:13:25]  with like an 11 perception.
[00:13:25 -> 00:13:27]  I wouldn't say like if you're
[00:13:27 -> 00:13:29]  like eavesdropping kind of like laying
[00:13:29 -> 00:13:31]  back a bit most
[00:13:31 -> 00:13:33]  of the conversation is talking about
[00:13:33 -> 00:13:35]  people. It would just be like
[00:13:35 -> 00:13:37]  Oh, yes. Yes.
[00:13:37 -> 00:13:39]  Like the baron
[00:13:39 -> 00:13:41]  so-and-so
[00:13:41 -> 00:13:43]  did you hear he like
[00:13:43 -> 00:13:45]  like kind of like it's a lot of
[00:13:45 -> 00:13:47]  gossip kind of catching up some
[00:13:47 -> 00:13:49]  some of the conversations are about business.
[00:13:51 -> 00:13:53]  Like it would be more like
[00:13:53 -> 00:13:55]  Oh, yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.
[00:13:55 -> 00:13:57]  I brought my wares all the way
[00:13:57 -> 00:13:59]  from
[00:14:01 -> 00:14:03]  I've just brought a load. Sorry.
[00:14:03 -> 00:14:05]  I really
[00:14:05 -> 00:14:07]  hold on
[00:14:07 -> 00:14:09]  from Boisden. I brought
[00:14:09 -> 00:14:11]  I brought some lumber hoping that
[00:14:11 -> 00:14:13]  the Duke would purchase it
[00:14:13 -> 00:14:15]  others kind
[00:14:15 -> 00:14:17]  of mentioning
[00:14:17 -> 00:14:19]  different stuff too.
[00:14:19 -> 00:14:21]  There's a bit of chatter I would say around
[00:14:21 -> 00:14:23]  Ophelia as well being like
[00:14:23 -> 00:14:25]  Oh, yes.
[00:14:25 -> 00:14:27]  Her grace Ophelia
[00:14:27 -> 00:14:29]  so stunning.
[00:14:29 -> 00:14:31]  I wonder
[00:14:31 -> 00:14:33]  how things will change now that she's back
[00:14:33 -> 00:14:35]  from college.
[00:14:35 -> 00:14:37]  She was ever close with her uncle.
[00:14:37 -> 00:14:39]  Do I see Ophelia in
[00:14:39 -> 00:14:41]  on the
[00:14:41 -> 00:14:43]  anywhere?
[00:14:43 -> 00:14:45]  I would say
[00:14:45 -> 00:14:47]  another I would say
[00:14:47 -> 00:14:52]  Who's Ophelia again?
[00:14:52 -> 00:14:54]  Sorry.
[00:14:54 -> 00:14:56]  Ophelia is heir to the Grand Duchy.
[00:14:56 -> 00:15:01]  Oh, God.
[00:15:01 -> 00:15:03]  If you're
[00:15:03 -> 00:15:05]  specifically looking for her
[00:15:05 -> 00:15:07]  investigation.
[00:15:07 -> 00:15:09]  Let's do it.
[00:15:09 -> 00:15:11]  These are all like bad
[00:15:11 -> 00:15:13]  bad things for me to rule.
[00:15:13 -> 00:15:15]  13.
[00:15:15 -> 00:15:17]  She's not trying to hide herself.
[00:15:17 -> 00:15:19]  You can kind of see her across from the
[00:15:19 -> 00:15:21]  dance floor.
[00:15:21 -> 00:15:23]  Like straight line
[00:15:23 -> 00:15:25]  on the other side of the dance floor and
[00:15:25 -> 00:15:27]  she looks like she's still kind of
[00:15:27 -> 00:15:29]  moving between the crowds on her
[00:15:29 -> 00:15:31]  own. Oh, fantastic.
[00:15:31 -> 00:15:33]  Okay, I'm gonna I'm also
[00:15:33 -> 00:15:35]  gonna join the
[00:15:35 -> 00:15:37]  dancing. See if I can
[00:15:37 -> 00:15:39]  performance subtly. I want to
[00:15:39 -> 00:15:41]  subtly move towards Ophelia.
[00:15:41 -> 00:15:43]  We'll see how
[00:15:43 -> 00:15:45]  subtle it is. Oh, okay.
[00:15:45 -> 00:15:49]  Oh, dirty 20.
[00:15:49 -> 00:15:51]  Oh, yeah, you're blending
[00:15:51 -> 00:15:53]  right in like you
[00:15:53 -> 00:15:55]  get close to Witty and like
[00:15:55 -> 00:15:57]  Witty is like about to hit you and you just
[00:15:57 -> 00:15:59]  like slide kind of elegantly like
[00:15:59 -> 00:16:01]  move out of the way like as well.
[00:16:01 -> 00:16:03]  Like I want to I want to add
[00:16:03 -> 00:16:05]  not just subtle like a suave
[00:16:05 -> 00:16:07]  dance performance.
[00:16:07 -> 00:16:09]  Okay. Oh, yeah.
[00:16:09 -> 00:16:11]  Noticeable.
[00:16:11 -> 00:16:13]  Oh, are you like peacocking?
[00:16:13 -> 00:16:15]  Oh, yeah. Yeah, gonna gonna try to
[00:16:15 -> 00:16:17]  move out towards Ophelia.
[00:16:17 -> 00:16:19]  Okay.
[00:16:19 -> 00:16:21]  Hmm.
[00:16:21 -> 00:16:23]  Roll persuasion.
[00:16:23 -> 00:16:25]  Roll persuasion.
[00:16:25 -> 00:16:27]  Roll persuasion.
[00:16:27 -> 00:16:29]  Okay.
[00:16:29 -> 00:16:31]  Oh, God.
[00:16:31 -> 00:16:33]  You know what? I would say with a dirty 20
[00:16:33 -> 00:16:35]  we'll give you advantage. Roll again.
[00:16:35 -> 00:16:37]  See if you can get a not 20.
[00:16:37 -> 00:16:41]  Oh, okay. Okay.
[00:16:41 -> 00:16:43]  No, 23. Okay.
[00:16:43 -> 00:16:45]  I would say, yeah.
[00:16:45 -> 00:16:47]  So as you kind of approach
[00:16:47 -> 00:16:49]  close to Ophelia now,
[00:16:49 -> 00:16:51]  are you like breaking away from it
[00:16:51 -> 00:16:53]  or
[00:16:53 -> 00:16:55]  like you're as close as you can get to
[00:16:55 -> 00:16:57]  her. If you
[00:16:57 -> 00:16:59]  to approach her, you
[00:16:59 -> 00:17:01]  would have to
[00:17:01 -> 00:17:03]  you'd have to break away from
[00:17:03 -> 00:17:05]  like the dance circle.
[00:17:05 -> 00:17:07]  Let me dance for a little bit.
[00:17:07 -> 00:17:09]  I'm gonna eat food
[00:17:09 -> 00:17:11]  IRL right now.
[00:17:11 -> 00:17:13]  Okay. I'm very confused.
[00:17:13 -> 00:17:15]  Yes, we can cut scene to
[00:17:15 -> 00:17:17]  everyone else. Thank you.
[00:17:17 -> 00:17:19]  Okay.
[00:17:19 -> 00:17:21]  We'll pick it up where we were.
[00:17:21 -> 00:17:23]  That's fine.
[00:17:23 -> 00:17:25]  Yes. So anyone
[00:17:25 -> 00:17:27]  anyone else?
[00:17:27 -> 00:17:29]  So Alara, fourth brother,
[00:17:29 -> 00:17:34]  fifth brother.
[00:17:34 -> 00:17:36]  Which brother am I? The fourth or the fifth?
[00:17:36 -> 00:17:38]  You're the fifth. You're the priest.
[00:17:38 -> 00:17:40]  You're the one that donned the robes.
[00:17:40 -> 00:17:42]  Is there
[00:17:42 -> 00:17:44]  I'm assuming there's a congregation of like
[00:17:44 -> 00:17:46]  priests nearby.
[00:17:46 -> 00:17:48]  Like they're like at the ball.
[00:17:48 -> 00:17:50]  Like, is there like a noticeable group of
[00:17:50 -> 00:17:52]  clergy people?
[00:17:52 -> 00:17:54]  Well, um,
[00:17:54 -> 00:17:56]  can I roll perception for you?
[00:17:56 -> 00:17:58]  Yes, please.
[00:17:58 -> 00:18:00]  Block.
[00:18:00 -> 00:18:02]  Uh,
[00:18:02 -> 00:18:04]  that's persuasion. Perception. You have a plus
[00:18:04 -> 00:18:06]  zero.
[00:18:06 -> 00:18:08]  Well, I'm not my old character.
[00:18:08 -> 00:18:11]  Wait.
[00:18:11 -> 00:18:15]  Did it?
[00:18:15 -> 00:18:17]  Wait, does it allow me to
[00:18:17 -> 00:18:19]  roll for you?
[00:18:19 -> 00:18:21]  That's not coming up on mine.
[00:18:21 -> 00:18:23]  Yeah, it's not coming up on mine either.
[00:18:23 -> 00:18:25]  It's a zero.
[00:18:25 -> 00:18:27]  Yeah, I'm just gonna roll a
[00:18:27 -> 00:18:29]  20 here.
[00:18:29 -> 00:18:31]  It's a nine.
[00:18:31 -> 00:18:33]  Why isn't it coming up?
[00:18:33 -> 00:18:35]  It's still rolling.
[00:18:35 -> 00:18:37]  Oh, yeah.
[00:18:37 -> 00:18:39]  It's laggy, though.
[00:18:39 -> 00:18:41]  Like, I knew
[00:18:41 -> 00:18:43]  Din saw his roll
[00:18:43 -> 00:18:45]  before I saw it.
[00:18:45 -> 00:18:50]  Yeah.
[00:18:50 -> 00:18:52]  Yeah, so it's
[00:18:52 -> 00:18:54]  a nine.
[00:18:54 -> 00:18:56]  Yeah, you
[00:18:56 -> 00:18:58]  it's hard to, I would say you have a
[00:18:58 -> 00:19:00]  harder time in the dark.
[00:19:00 -> 00:19:02]  Yeah, your passive perception's a ten,
[00:19:02 -> 00:19:04]  so it wasn't even gonna help you there.
[00:19:06 -> 00:19:08]  Um, yeah.
[00:19:08 -> 00:19:10]  You can't quite see.
[00:19:10 -> 00:19:12]  You do know
[00:19:12 -> 00:19:14]  Alara would be here.
[00:19:14 -> 00:19:16]  True.
[00:19:16 -> 00:19:18]  Yeah.
[00:19:18 -> 00:19:20]  Um, can I, do I
[00:19:20 -> 00:19:22]  see her anywhere? Like, I don't, I'm assuming
[00:19:22 -> 00:19:24]  she would be in the group.
[00:19:24 -> 00:19:26]  I would say
[00:19:26 -> 00:19:28]  for a while, you would eventually find
[00:19:28 -> 00:19:30]  her. Like, it would take you
[00:19:30 -> 00:19:32]  a bit to find her, just with, like, you know.
[00:19:32 -> 00:19:34]  The only other one there is Proctor Edward, right?
[00:19:34 -> 00:19:36]  Yeah, you would be with Proctor
[00:19:36 -> 00:19:38]  Edward. Oh, there's no other, like,
[00:19:38 -> 00:19:40]  I don't know, like, clergy.
[00:19:40 -> 00:19:42]  No, not. Okay.
[00:19:42 -> 00:19:44]  Like, Proctor Edward is
[00:19:44 -> 00:19:46]  Yes, but, like, clergy
[00:19:46 -> 00:19:48]  normally is, wouldn't really
[00:19:48 -> 00:19:50]  be invited. Like, think of it, it's
[00:19:50 -> 00:19:52]  like, like,
[00:19:52 -> 00:19:54]  okay, yes, they would be invited
[00:19:54 -> 00:19:56]  in a way as much as, like, the popes in
[00:19:56 -> 00:19:58]  Italy and, like. Yeah.
[00:19:58 -> 00:20:00]  Yeah, but, like,
[00:20:00 -> 00:20:02]  here, it's very
[00:20:02 -> 00:20:04]  much, uh, it's Proctor
[00:20:04 -> 00:20:06]  Edward's representing the Seminary. We're
[00:20:06 -> 00:20:08]  not in the capital, right? This is not
[00:20:08 -> 00:20:10]  Oh, it's true, it's true.
[00:20:10 -> 00:20:12]  This is not, uh,
[00:20:12 -> 00:20:14]  like, Eulogia has power
[00:20:14 -> 00:20:16]  as much as it has power in the Empire, but this is
[00:20:16 -> 00:20:18]  not, like, the beating heart of Eulogia either.
[00:20:18 -> 00:20:20]  Yeah. Um,
[00:20:20 -> 00:20:22]  okay, uh, are they serving
[00:20:22 -> 00:20:24]  food? Oh, yeah,
[00:20:24 -> 00:20:26]  there are, um, you see
[00:20:26 -> 00:20:28]  servants, like, uh, kind of
[00:20:28 -> 00:20:30]  effectively, uh,
[00:20:30 -> 00:20:32]  all, like, black tie,
[00:20:32 -> 00:20:34]  white shirt servants
[00:20:34 -> 00:20:36]  kind of walking around with plates
[00:20:36 -> 00:20:38]  and drinks. Okay.
[00:20:38 -> 00:20:40]  Um, I would like to
[00:20:40 -> 00:20:42]  follow the one that, like, not follow, but
[00:20:42 -> 00:20:44]  follow the one that has, looks like
[00:20:44 -> 00:20:46]  the most appetizing food.
[00:20:46 -> 00:20:48]  Okay.
[00:20:48 -> 00:20:50]  Um,
[00:20:50 -> 00:20:52]  I mean, this is probably Isidore's first
[00:20:52 -> 00:20:54]  not probably, like, it's
[00:20:54 -> 00:20:56]  definitely his first ever
[00:20:56 -> 00:20:58]  ball or event of this magnitude, for
[00:20:58 -> 00:21:00]  sure. Um,
[00:21:00 -> 00:21:02]  What would be appealing to Isidore,
[00:21:02 -> 00:21:04]  like, for food-wise?
[00:21:04 -> 00:21:06]  Um,
[00:21:06 -> 00:21:08]  anything
[00:21:08 -> 00:21:10]  meaty or,
[00:21:10 -> 00:21:12]  like, fish, but probably more meat
[00:21:12 -> 00:21:14]  because it's rarer in the village.
[00:21:14 -> 00:21:16]  Yeah, so you see
[00:21:16 -> 00:21:18]  effectively little pigs in a blanket,
[00:21:18 -> 00:21:20]  like, uh,
[00:21:20 -> 00:21:22]  uh, and the
[00:21:22 -> 00:21:24]  servant turns to you and goes, oh,
[00:21:24 -> 00:21:26]  um, brother,
[00:21:26 -> 00:21:28]  care for some, and, like, kind of lowers the plate
[00:21:28 -> 00:21:30]  towards you. Brother.
[00:21:30 -> 00:21:32]  I, like, an extra, I see
[00:21:32 -> 00:21:34]  um, I grab
[00:21:34 -> 00:21:36]  a plate, like, the entire plate,
[00:21:36 -> 00:21:38]  and I just go,
[00:21:38 -> 00:21:40]  uh,
[00:21:40 -> 00:21:42]  thank you, uh, young sir.
[00:21:42 -> 00:21:44]  And I just walk away
[00:21:44 -> 00:21:46]  and start cowing down on those
[00:21:46 -> 00:21:48]  pigs in a blanket.
[00:21:48 -> 00:21:50]  The servant
[00:21:50 -> 00:21:52]  just, like, looked
[00:21:52 -> 00:21:54]  and was like,
[00:21:54 -> 00:21:56]  no, I don't get paid enough.
[00:21:56 -> 00:21:58]  Like,
[00:21:58 -> 00:22:00]  just goes,
[00:22:00 -> 00:22:02]  disappears, as they kind of
[00:22:02 -> 00:22:04]  are able to kind of, you know, blend
[00:22:04 -> 00:22:06]  in as they're trained to,
[00:22:06 -> 00:22:08]  like, probably to get another plate.
[00:22:08 -> 00:22:10]  And then is
[00:22:10 -> 00:22:12]  there a plate of alcohol being served somewhere?
[00:22:12 -> 00:22:14]  Oh, a hundred percent.
[00:22:14 -> 00:22:16]  Like, there's another tray with, like,
[00:22:16 -> 00:22:18]  um, see,
[00:22:18 -> 00:22:20]  um, so I would say,
[00:22:20 -> 00:22:22]  like, you would see, like, each
[00:22:22 -> 00:22:24]  tray, like, different servants will have
[00:22:24 -> 00:22:26]  different kinds of glasses all of the same.
[00:22:26 -> 00:22:30]  kind of content.
[00:22:30 -> 00:22:32]  Okay, um, then I would take
[00:22:32 -> 00:22:35]  Yeah?
[00:22:35 -> 00:22:37]  I would say that there are one
[00:22:37 -> 00:22:39]  tray with, like, red wine, like,
[00:22:39 -> 00:22:41]  dark, like, wine glasses with
[00:22:41 -> 00:22:43]  dark color liquid, wine glasses with a
[00:22:43 -> 00:22:45]  lighter color liquid, there's some
[00:22:45 -> 00:22:47]  short, like, glasses
[00:22:47 -> 00:22:49]  with golden liquids, like,
[00:22:49 -> 00:22:51]  I start collecting them. I'm putting
[00:22:51 -> 00:22:53]  them all, I'm taking as many glasses
[00:22:53 -> 00:22:55]  and putting them on my platter.
[00:22:55 -> 00:22:57]  Um, so I have, like,
[00:22:57 -> 00:22:59]  one serving platter that's
[00:22:59 -> 00:23:01]  almost empty of pigs in a blanket, and then
[00:23:01 -> 00:23:03]  in that same platter, you can
[00:23:03 -> 00:23:05]  start, like, collecting glasses
[00:23:05 -> 00:23:07]  and drink them, basically.
[00:23:07 -> 00:23:18]  Um, roll?
[00:23:18 -> 00:23:20]  I am
[00:23:20 -> 00:23:22]  going to have you
[00:23:22 -> 00:23:24]  roll charisma?
[00:23:24 -> 00:23:26]  That's not quite that.
[00:23:26 -> 00:23:28]  With disadvantage?
[00:23:28 -> 00:23:30]  With disadvantage.
[00:23:30 -> 00:23:32]  You are breaking social
[00:23:32 -> 00:23:35]  etiquette.
[00:23:35 -> 00:23:37]  Back there, back there.
[00:23:37 -> 00:23:39]  Do I see this? Yay.
[00:23:39 -> 00:23:41]  Ooh.
[00:23:41 -> 00:23:43]  Wait, that's an eight
[00:23:43 -> 00:23:45]  plus, uh, wait,
[00:23:45 -> 00:23:49]  this is weird, it did
[00:23:49 -> 00:23:53]  No?
[00:23:53 -> 00:23:58]  This is pissing me off.
[00:23:58 -> 00:24:00]  Okay, that's
[00:24:00 -> 00:24:04]  how you do it. You got a four.
[00:24:04 -> 00:24:06]  Um,
[00:24:06 -> 00:24:08]  you're standing out
[00:24:08 -> 00:24:10]  like a sore thumb.
[00:24:10 -> 00:24:12]  Like, people
[00:24:12 -> 00:24:14]  are, um, I would
[00:24:14 -> 00:24:16]  say to anyone in the group,
[00:24:16 -> 00:24:18]  uh, you would, you would start
[00:24:18 -> 00:24:20]  hearing, at some point, some
[00:24:20 -> 00:24:22]  whisperings about, like,
[00:24:22 -> 00:24:24]  they're, they're, like, you're being a topic
[00:24:24 -> 00:24:26]  of gossip.
[00:24:26 -> 00:24:28]  I'm gonna ask Dr. Edward,
[00:24:28 -> 00:24:30]  do you know who that brother
[00:24:30 -> 00:24:32]  is? I keep hearing about
[00:24:32 -> 00:24:34]  him.
[00:24:34 -> 00:24:36]  Oh, I didn't know, I forgot about that.
[00:24:36 -> 00:24:38]  Yeah, um,
[00:24:38 -> 00:24:40]  yeah, Dr. Edward goes, um,
[00:24:40 -> 00:24:42]  and, like, discreetly,
[00:24:42 -> 00:24:44]  kind of in between, like,
[00:24:44 -> 00:24:46]  like, kind of, uh, as
[00:24:46 -> 00:24:48]  you part from someone else, because you guys kind of
[00:24:48 -> 00:24:50]  hear the rumors, and he, like, looks
[00:24:50 -> 00:24:52]  over, and he goes,
[00:24:52 -> 00:24:54]  uh, yes, Sister
[00:24:54 -> 00:24:56]  Alara, I do not recognize
[00:24:56 -> 00:24:58]  him. He is wearing
[00:24:58 -> 00:25:00]  strings. I do wonder
[00:25:00 -> 00:25:02]  how he got here.
[00:25:02 -> 00:25:04]  Um, and you
[00:25:04 -> 00:25:06]  do see, uh, he kind of,
[00:25:06 -> 00:25:08]  if you give me a moment, um,
[00:25:08 -> 00:25:10]  and he kind of moves to one social
[00:25:10 -> 00:25:12]  circle, uh, few social circles,
[00:25:12 -> 00:25:14]  and comes back.
[00:25:14 -> 00:25:16]  Apparently, um, there
[00:25:16 -> 00:25:18]  is a noble family, one of the
[00:25:18 -> 00:25:20]  siblings
[00:25:20 -> 00:25:22]  took to Eulogia
[00:25:22 -> 00:25:24]  and is in attendance.
[00:25:24 -> 00:25:26]  So, I was not aware of
[00:25:26 -> 00:25:28]  that. Maybe we should introduce
[00:25:28 -> 00:25:30]  ourselves as the official
[00:25:30 -> 00:25:33]  representation
[00:25:33 -> 00:25:36]  of the Eulogia.
[00:25:36 -> 00:25:38]  She just kind of, like, nods along.
[00:25:40 -> 00:25:42]  Because she's curious.
[00:25:42 -> 00:25:44]  Um, yeah, and
[00:25:44 -> 00:25:46]  you, um, I will say,
[00:25:46 -> 00:25:48]  uh, Yastur, you see,
[00:25:48 -> 00:25:50]  like, um,
[00:25:50 -> 00:25:52]  you, you see this
[00:25:52 -> 00:25:54]  well, like, you know,
[00:25:54 -> 00:25:56]  salt-pepper-haired,
[00:25:56 -> 00:25:58]  slicked-back, wearing
[00:25:58 -> 00:26:00]  Eulogian robes, but, like,
[00:26:00 -> 00:26:02]  very fine ones
[00:26:02 -> 00:26:04]  approach with Alara.
[00:26:04 -> 00:26:06]  And, uh, he goes,
[00:26:06 -> 00:26:08]  Brother, um, I believe it's
[00:26:08 -> 00:26:12]  ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
[00:26:12 -> 00:26:14]  Sorry. Uh,
[00:26:14 -> 00:26:16]  well, well, he,
[00:26:16 -> 00:26:18]  uh, Brother,
[00:26:18 -> 00:26:20]  Brother Windtaker, I,
[00:26:20 -> 00:26:26]  I take it. Oh, Mark's just
[00:26:26 -> 00:26:28]  switching audio now that he's back.
[00:26:28 -> 00:26:30]  Um,
[00:26:30 -> 00:26:32]  yeah, because
[00:26:32 -> 00:26:34]  what I'm implying is the rumors,
[00:26:34 -> 00:26:36]  people are putting it together,
[00:26:36 -> 00:26:38]  the entrance, and so
[00:26:38 -> 00:26:40]  he got from other people.
[00:26:40 -> 00:26:42]  That's how he knows the names, not magic psychic.
[00:26:42 -> 00:26:44]  Like, that's why he excused himself
[00:26:44 -> 00:26:46]  for a hot second. He, he was
[00:26:46 -> 00:26:48]  like, oh, like, let's see what,
[00:26:48 -> 00:26:50]  what's the rumors are.
[00:26:50 -> 00:26:52]  He has a magical rolodex.
[00:26:52 -> 00:26:54]  Yeah, a magical rolodex of all the Eulogians.
[00:26:54 -> 00:26:56]  Yeah.
[00:26:56 -> 00:26:58]  Populates only if
[00:26:58 -> 00:27:00]  you're a true believer.
[00:27:00 -> 00:27:02]  You get that once you achieve level seven
[00:27:02 -> 00:27:04]  in the organization.
[00:27:04 -> 00:27:06]  You have to remember, like, does
[00:27:06 -> 00:27:08]  Isador, is he,
[00:27:08 -> 00:27:10]  is his religion
[00:27:10 -> 00:27:12]  of love thing, is that related
[00:27:12 -> 00:27:14]  to Eulogia? It's like a subsect
[00:27:14 -> 00:27:16]  or is it? Mark said no.
[00:27:16 -> 00:27:18]  Yeah.
[00:27:18 -> 00:27:20]  Like, it's, it's like a folk religion.
[00:27:20 -> 00:27:22]  So,
[00:27:22 -> 00:27:24]  like, Eulogia hasn't even, like, really made it
[00:27:24 -> 00:27:26]  to my village. Like, we've heard
[00:27:26 -> 00:27:28]  about it, but it's not, um,
[00:27:28 -> 00:27:30]  He's a heretic. Yeah, like, heretic
[00:27:30 -> 00:27:32]  through and through. It's all just like, oh, we
[00:27:32 -> 00:27:34]  interpret it differently. It's like, no, no, no.
[00:27:34 -> 00:27:36]  We don't believe in whatever you have.
[00:27:36 -> 00:27:38]  It's a completely different, um,
[00:27:38 -> 00:27:40]  belief system.
[00:27:40 -> 00:27:44]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:27:44 -> 00:27:46]  Okay, we'll be
[00:27:46 -> 00:27:48]  Okay, yeah, he's just rejoining.
[00:27:48 -> 00:27:51]  Have you heard of our lord and savior
[00:27:51 -> 00:27:53]  Jesus? He's like, um,
[00:27:53 -> 00:27:55]  I don't think we have a Jesus in our
[00:27:55 -> 00:27:57]  village.
[00:27:57 -> 00:27:59]  Yeah.
[00:27:59 -> 00:28:01]  Oh!
[00:28:01 -> 00:28:03]  Hey, it's like,
[00:28:03 -> 00:28:05]  I know a Jesus, but I don't think
[00:28:05 -> 00:28:07]  He's your savior?
[00:28:07 -> 00:28:09]  It's kind of sketch.
[00:28:09 -> 00:28:12]  Yeah, like, he walked out on his wife.
[00:28:12 -> 00:28:14]  Yeah.
[00:28:14 -> 00:28:16]  He has a gambling addiction.
[00:28:18 -> 00:28:20]  Um.
[00:28:20 -> 00:28:22]  Is it working? Yeah.
[00:28:22 -> 00:28:24]  Wait, I can't hear you.
[00:28:24 -> 00:28:26]  No, no, I think
[00:28:26 -> 00:28:28]  it's just the output is wrong.
[00:28:28 -> 00:28:30]  Yeah, okay. Okay, perfect.
[00:28:30 -> 00:28:32]  It's so dark, though. Okay, whatever.
[00:28:32 -> 00:28:34]  You're shadowed, after all.
[00:28:34 -> 00:28:36]  Yeah!
[00:28:36 -> 00:28:38]  It's because the
[00:28:38 -> 00:28:40]  sun's coming up to, like,
[00:28:40 -> 00:28:42]  this side of the house.
[00:28:42 -> 00:28:44]  And then, like, the mirror's reflecting
[00:28:44 -> 00:28:46]  As you can see,
[00:28:46 -> 00:28:48]  like, the lens flare on my side,
[00:28:48 -> 00:28:50]  the mirror's reflecting the sunlight.
[00:28:50 -> 00:28:52]  And then...
[00:28:52 -> 00:28:54]  Yeah? Yeah, okay. Yeah, it does.
[00:28:54 -> 00:28:56]  Okay, perfect.
[00:28:56 -> 00:28:58]  Okay, where were we? Sorry.
[00:28:58 -> 00:29:00]  Yeah, so Proctor, um,
[00:29:00 -> 00:29:02]  Alara approaches you,
[00:29:02 -> 00:29:04]  um, with an
[00:29:04 -> 00:29:06]  older, probably in his 50s,
[00:29:06 -> 00:29:08]  salt-and-pepper-haired, fine
[00:29:08 -> 00:29:10]  robes, um, similar
[00:29:10 -> 00:29:12]  style of yours, but very much more
[00:29:12 -> 00:29:14]  expendy, um,
[00:29:14 -> 00:29:16]  and, uh, with Alara,
[00:29:16 -> 00:29:18]  and he goes, um,
[00:29:18 -> 00:29:20]  Brother Whitaker, uh, Brother, uh,
[00:29:20 -> 00:29:22]  Whitman, he's referring to you,
[00:29:22 -> 00:29:24]  actually, no, he would say Brother Whitaker,
[00:29:24 -> 00:29:26]  Brother Whitaker, I take it, um,
[00:29:26 -> 00:29:28]  Whitaker the Fifth,
[00:29:28 -> 00:29:30]  um, how do you do?
[00:29:30 -> 00:29:32]  Um,
[00:29:32 -> 00:29:34]  mouth, like, half
[00:29:34 -> 00:29:36]  full of food, like, for sure,
[00:29:36 -> 00:29:38]  um,
[00:29:38 -> 00:29:40]  I, like, wipe my
[00:29:40 -> 00:29:42]  hand, like, my hand that was eating down
[00:29:42 -> 00:29:44]  on my robes, um,
[00:29:44 -> 00:29:46]  I, I,
[00:29:46 -> 00:29:48]  I do well, sir,
[00:29:48 -> 00:29:50]  how, how do
[00:29:50 -> 00:29:52]  you? Would I know who
[00:29:52 -> 00:29:54]  pro- like, a,
[00:29:54 -> 00:29:56]  Yisro doesn't know, and Whitaker, I'm assuming,
[00:29:56 -> 00:29:58]  doesn't know either.
[00:29:58 -> 00:30:00]  Probably not.
[00:30:00 -> 00:30:02]  Probably wouldn't know,
[00:30:02 -> 00:30:04]  or if he does, you don't know if he does.
[00:30:06 -> 00:30:08]  Yeah, sure. Um,
[00:30:08 -> 00:30:10]  uh, you, all you would have is
[00:30:10 -> 00:30:12]  he's wearing, he's with
[00:30:12 -> 00:30:14]  Alara,
[00:30:14 -> 00:30:16]  um, and, uh,
[00:30:16 -> 00:30:18]  he is wearing, like, expe-
[00:30:18 -> 00:30:20]  like, very fine versions of the same
[00:30:20 -> 00:30:22]  clothing.
[00:30:22 -> 00:30:28]  Mm-hmm. Alara, just
[00:30:28 -> 00:30:30]  interject and say,
[00:30:30 -> 00:30:32]  I find it so
[00:30:32 -> 00:30:34]  humbling that, uh,
[00:30:34 -> 00:30:36]  a person from noble origins
[00:30:36 -> 00:30:38]  would choose this life
[00:30:38 -> 00:30:40]  when they had all the other options available.
[00:30:40 -> 00:30:46]  Uh,
[00:30:46 -> 00:30:48]  well,
[00:30:48 -> 00:30:50]  humbleness
[00:30:50 -> 00:30:52]  is often the
[00:30:52 -> 00:30:54]  key- Yisro's stumbling, like, he
[00:30:54 -> 00:30:56]  clearly doesn't know, he doesn't know any
[00:30:56 -> 00:30:58]  of the- he knows Alara's there,
[00:30:58 -> 00:31:00]  doesn't know Proctor ever, out of
[00:31:00 -> 00:31:02]  his depth, um,
[00:31:02 -> 00:31:04]  while humbleness is
[00:31:04 -> 00:31:06]  the key to salvation,
[00:31:06 -> 00:31:15]  as they say,
[00:31:15 -> 00:31:17]  and persuasion with dis-
[00:31:17 -> 00:31:19]  advantage. Oh, come on!
[00:31:19 -> 00:31:22]  Wait, should I roll, like, a two or something?
[00:31:22 -> 00:31:26]  Okay. Fifteen.
[00:31:26 -> 00:31:28]  I said
[00:31:28 -> 00:31:30]  with disadvantage. No, that's
[00:31:30 -> 00:31:32]  with disadvantage. I, uh, rolled the
[00:31:32 -> 00:31:34]  automatic one. Oh, okay, yeah,
[00:31:34 -> 00:31:36]  fifteen. Uh, yeah, so,
[00:31:36 -> 00:31:41]  right words, but the heart's
[00:31:41 -> 00:31:43]  there. Uh,
[00:31:43 -> 00:31:45]  I am Proctor Goes to Edwards, yes, yes.
[00:31:45 -> 00:31:47]  Um, I too,
[00:31:47 -> 00:31:49]  um, though
[00:31:49 -> 00:31:51]  I don't know a lot- sister Alara, I don't
[00:31:51 -> 00:31:53]  know if you're aware, but, um, I too do
[00:31:53 -> 00:31:55]  come from
[00:31:55 -> 00:31:57]  a more, um,
[00:31:57 -> 00:31:59]  elated background, and
[00:31:59 -> 00:32:01]  yes, there is some nobility
[00:32:01 -> 00:32:03]  to be had in choosing
[00:32:03 -> 00:32:05]  this path without,
[00:32:05 -> 00:32:07]  um, you know,
[00:32:07 -> 00:32:09]  despite our
[00:32:09 -> 00:32:11]  advantage upbringing. Um,
[00:32:11 -> 00:32:13]  I will, uh,
[00:32:13 -> 00:32:15]  yes, I am Proctor Edwards,
[00:32:15 -> 00:32:17]  um, I am in charge
[00:32:17 -> 00:32:19]  of the Eulogian Seminary here.
[00:32:19 -> 00:32:21]  Um, with me is
[00:32:21 -> 00:32:23]  um, Alara,
[00:32:23 -> 00:32:25]  uh, Sister Alara. She is
[00:32:25 -> 00:32:27]  a newer rival that has
[00:32:27 -> 00:32:29]  expressed curiosity in how
[00:32:29 -> 00:32:31]  Eulogia and the nobilities
[00:32:31 -> 00:32:33]  as well as the local
[00:32:33 -> 00:32:35]  research
[00:32:35 -> 00:32:37]  institute are interacting as-
[00:32:37 -> 00:32:39]  and since that's part of my role, I've
[00:32:39 -> 00:32:41]  decided to bring her here
[00:32:41 -> 00:32:43]  tonight. Um,
[00:32:43 -> 00:32:45]  I assume you're staying with family,
[00:32:45 -> 00:32:47]  but you are most welcome to the seminary
[00:32:47 -> 00:32:49]  as any of those of
[00:32:49 -> 00:32:51]  the faith are. Um,
[00:32:51 -> 00:32:53]  you should come for
[00:32:53 -> 00:32:55]  one of our morning rituals.
[00:32:55 -> 00:32:58]  Absolutely,
[00:32:58 -> 00:33:00]  I would- I would love to,
[00:33:00 -> 00:33:02]  to see how, uh, things are
[00:33:02 -> 00:33:04]  done in this city.
[00:33:04 -> 00:33:06]  And not to-
[00:33:06 -> 00:33:08]  I know sometimes it's a bit different
[00:33:08 -> 00:33:10]  from areas to areas,
[00:33:10 -> 00:33:12]  and I know,
[00:33:12 -> 00:33:14]  uh, Vasilia is known for
[00:33:14 -> 00:33:16]  its wine, but do
[00:33:16 -> 00:33:18]  remember that
[00:33:18 -> 00:33:20]  the light does appreciate
[00:33:20 -> 00:33:22]  moderation, regardless
[00:33:22 -> 00:33:24]  of what some of,
[00:33:24 -> 00:33:26]  uh, nobility
[00:33:26 -> 00:33:28]  may think. Do
[00:33:28 -> 00:33:30]  watch yourself.
[00:33:30 -> 00:33:32]  Um, Ysera's confused because
[00:33:32 -> 00:33:34]  this is moderation for him. Like, this is, like,
[00:33:34 -> 00:33:36]  like,
[00:33:36 -> 00:33:38]  six doth is probably, like, the equivalent of one.
[00:33:38 -> 00:33:40]  Um, she's like,
[00:33:40 -> 00:33:42]  uh, yes, yes,
[00:33:42 -> 00:33:44]  I- I- I do
[00:33:44 -> 00:33:46]  make sure to
[00:33:46 -> 00:33:48]  stay within the limits of my body.
[00:33:48 -> 00:33:53]  And he kind of goes,
[00:33:53 -> 00:33:55]  mm, very well. Uh, well,
[00:33:55 -> 00:33:57]  um,
[00:33:57 -> 00:33:59]  actually,
[00:33:59 -> 00:34:01]  I do need to speak
[00:34:01 -> 00:34:03]  to, um,
[00:34:03 -> 00:34:05]  Lord Rius and his
[00:34:05 -> 00:34:07]  grace a little bit more
[00:34:07 -> 00:34:09]  on some matters. Um,
[00:34:09 -> 00:34:11]  it would just bore you a trifling,
[00:34:11 -> 00:34:13]  Alara, but, um,
[00:34:13 -> 00:34:15]  how about, uh, as
[00:34:15 -> 00:34:17]  newcomers to the city,
[00:34:17 -> 00:34:19]  how about, um, you play a bit of
[00:34:19 -> 00:34:21]  escort with this young gentleman?
[00:34:21 -> 00:34:27]  She just goes, uh,
[00:34:27 -> 00:34:29]  she's- she's, like, she looks at
[00:34:29 -> 00:34:32]  where the
[00:34:32 -> 00:34:34]  duke- the duke, I assume, would be
[00:34:34 -> 00:34:36]  somewhere sort of visible?
[00:34:36 -> 00:34:38]  Yeah.
[00:34:38 -> 00:34:42]  Um,
[00:34:42 -> 00:34:44]  Ophelia is not with him, right?
[00:34:44 -> 00:34:47]  Ophelia's doing her own thing.
[00:34:47 -> 00:34:49]  She just, like, looks
[00:34:49 -> 00:34:51]  towards the duke and then she kind of
[00:34:51 -> 00:34:53]  notices, and then just, like, nods, like,
[00:34:53 -> 00:34:55]  yes, of course, I- I would be delighted to.
[00:34:55 -> 00:34:59]  And, um,
[00:34:59 -> 00:35:01]  uh, Proctor Edward
[00:35:01 -> 00:35:06]  walks away.
[00:35:06 -> 00:35:08]  For a second, by the way, I thought you were gonna- he was gonna invite me
[00:35:08 -> 00:35:10]  to the duke, and I was like, that seems crazy.
[00:35:10 -> 00:35:12]  No.
[00:35:12 -> 00:35:14]  No. So, uh,
[00:35:14 -> 00:35:16]  Ysidore and Alara, you're alone together.
[00:35:16 -> 00:35:18]  And she-
[00:35:18 -> 00:35:20]  she just goes,
[00:35:20 -> 00:35:22]  you- you mentioned
[00:35:22 -> 00:35:24]  some differences in how we prac-
[00:35:24 -> 00:35:26]  my practice in the city, but
[00:35:26 -> 00:35:28]  I came from, uh, what was it
[00:35:28 -> 00:35:30]  called?
[00:35:30 -> 00:35:32]  Whatever, Arcos?
[00:35:32 -> 00:35:34]  I came from a place
[00:35:34 -> 00:35:36]  I think it's Arcos.
[00:35:36 -> 00:35:38]  Um.
[00:35:38 -> 00:35:40]  Can you remind me, like, we're disguised,
[00:35:40 -> 00:35:42]  right? I don't remember last-
[00:35:42 -> 00:35:44]  Yeah, you're fully in disguise.
[00:35:44 -> 00:35:46]  I assumed, but, like, I wasn't-
[00:35:46 -> 00:35:48]  I wanted to confirm.
[00:35:48 -> 00:35:50]  It's up to
[00:35:50 -> 00:35:52]  Ysidore whether or not
[00:35:52 -> 00:35:54]  Ysidore would have the wherewithal
[00:35:54 -> 00:35:56]  to
[00:35:56 -> 00:35:58]  whatever
[00:35:58 -> 00:36:00]  towards Alara.
[00:36:00 -> 00:36:02]  Oh, no, absolutely not.
[00:36:02 -> 00:36:04]  Um.
[00:36:04 -> 00:36:06]  I- I- Alara asked
[00:36:06 -> 00:36:08]  her question, and I just go,
[00:36:08 -> 00:36:10]  Alara, like, whispering, like,
[00:36:10 -> 00:36:12]  not that much whisper, like,
[00:36:12 -> 00:36:14]  it's still fairly loud. I'm like,
[00:36:14 -> 00:36:16]  shh, it's me. It's
[00:36:16 -> 00:36:20]  Ysidore.
[00:36:20 -> 00:36:22]  She goes- she, like,
[00:36:22 -> 00:36:24]  jolts, um, and then, like, tries
[00:36:24 -> 00:36:26]  to play it off and looks around.
[00:36:26 -> 00:36:28]  She's
[00:36:28 -> 00:36:32]  going, what?
[00:36:32 -> 00:36:34]  I don't know, they told me to put this on.
[00:36:34 -> 00:36:36]  I think I'm a rich person.
[00:36:36 -> 00:36:45]  Takes a couple of deep breaths.
[00:36:45 -> 00:36:47]  Says, like,
[00:36:47 -> 00:36:49]  she kind of mutters under her breath, I am so glad.
[00:36:49 -> 00:36:52]  That this is you and not Baradun.
[00:36:56 -> 00:36:58]  I just- with my platter,
[00:36:58 -> 00:37:00]  I'm like, would you like some wine?
[00:37:02 -> 00:37:04]  She just, like,
[00:37:04 -> 00:37:06]  takes a deep breath and says,
[00:37:06 -> 00:37:08]  why not?
[00:37:08 -> 00:37:10]  I'll have one.
[00:37:10 -> 00:37:14]  Thank you.
[00:37:14 -> 00:37:16]  So,
[00:37:16 -> 00:37:18]  while this is going on, what is brother number
[00:37:18 -> 00:37:20]  four doing? Just being broody?
[00:37:20 -> 00:37:22]  So, it-
[00:37:22 -> 00:37:24]  Yeah, I'm- I honestly-
[00:37:24 -> 00:37:26]  He's just- Nyx is just- brother number
[00:37:26 -> 00:37:28]  four is- is just trying to
[00:37:28 -> 00:37:30]  play that role,
[00:37:30 -> 00:37:32]  um, and is
[00:37:32 -> 00:37:34]  just watching
[00:37:34 -> 00:37:36]  what's happening to all
[00:37:36 -> 00:37:38]  the other brothers, and is just trying to get a
[00:37:38 -> 00:37:40]  lay of the land. Cause
[00:37:40 -> 00:37:42]  I'm, you know, it's-
[00:37:42 -> 00:37:44]  it's- I'm trying to
[00:37:44 -> 00:37:46]  think- I don't think Nyx has
[00:37:46 -> 00:37:48]  ever been invited- Nyx would never
[00:37:48 -> 00:37:50]  have been invited to any of these things, but he's, of course,
[00:37:50 -> 00:37:52]  known about them, and, um,
[00:37:52 -> 00:37:54]  you know,
[00:37:54 -> 00:37:56]  he knows that this is
[00:37:56 -> 00:37:58]  kinda how contra- sometimes
[00:37:58 -> 00:38:00]  contracts result from
[00:38:00 -> 00:38:02]  parties like these,
[00:38:02 -> 00:38:04]  um, but he's never
[00:38:04 -> 00:38:06]  been involved. So, yeah, just w-
[00:38:06 -> 00:38:08]  can I roll, like, what do you-
[00:38:08 -> 00:38:10]  I- I just wanna get a really good sense
[00:38:10 -> 00:38:12]  of what er- especially
[00:38:12 -> 00:38:14]  what all the brothers are doing,
[00:38:14 -> 00:38:16]  um, and who's talking
[00:38:16 -> 00:38:18]  to them.
[00:38:18 -> 00:38:20]  You don't wanna know.
[00:38:20 -> 00:38:22]  Uh, this would be perception,
[00:38:22 -> 00:38:27]  then. Okay.
[00:38:27 -> 00:38:29]  Do we have our weapons, by the way?
[00:38:29 -> 00:38:31]  Like, how do disguises work?
[00:38:31 -> 00:38:33]  I don't perceive shit.
[00:38:33 -> 00:38:35]  I'm so- Yeah, you're-
[00:38:35 -> 00:38:37]  you're- you're focusing on
[00:38:37 -> 00:38:39]  too much being the
[00:38:39 -> 00:38:41]  broody one, um, that
[00:38:41 -> 00:38:43]  actually, behind you, you
[00:38:43 -> 00:38:45]  hear a voice go,
[00:38:45 -> 00:38:47]  hm, we'll take our-
[00:38:47 -> 00:38:49]  we'll take our four.
[00:38:49 -> 00:38:51]  It's been a while.
[00:38:51 -> 00:38:53]  I turn around very
[00:38:53 -> 00:38:55]  slowly.
[00:38:55 -> 00:38:57]  Um, it's
[00:38:57 -> 00:38:59]  Jonathan Reeves.
[00:38:59 -> 00:39:03]  Ooh. I imagine
[00:39:03 -> 00:39:05]  we'll take our four sort of, like, dream in
[00:39:05 -> 00:39:07]  Sandman. Like, that's the sort of image I have
[00:39:07 -> 00:39:09]  going on right now.
[00:39:09 -> 00:39:11]  Wait, I need a- I- I saw some of
[00:39:11 -> 00:39:13]  Sandman, let me just see dream and-
[00:39:13 -> 00:39:15]  Um,
[00:39:15 -> 00:39:17]  and he's- he's talking about the Netflix show.
[00:39:17 -> 00:39:19]  I know, I know.
[00:39:19 -> 00:39:21]  Oh, hang on.
[00:39:21 -> 00:39:23]  Sorry. Oh, like, when he-
[00:39:23 -> 00:39:25]  Is that the guy? Oh, that's the guy.
[00:39:25 -> 00:39:27]  The main character. Yeah, that's the main character.
[00:39:27 -> 00:39:29]  The main character. Um,
[00:39:29 -> 00:39:31]  the Sandman. Sure. Let's go for that.
[00:39:31 -> 00:39:33]  Uh, yes. Jonathan Reeves goes,
[00:39:33 -> 00:39:35]  um,
[00:39:35 -> 00:39:37]  so, how did your
[00:39:37 -> 00:39:39]  brother- how did your brother convince
[00:39:39 -> 00:39:41]  you to come to this par- party or
[00:39:41 -> 00:39:43]  come here? Last I heard,
[00:39:43 -> 00:39:45]  you were up in Bwadan.
[00:39:45 -> 00:39:47]  Uh,
[00:39:47 -> 00:39:49]  well,
[00:39:49 -> 00:39:51]  I was busy,
[00:39:51 -> 00:39:53]  but he found
[00:39:53 -> 00:39:55]  he has a way
[00:39:55 -> 00:39:57]  of
[00:39:57 -> 00:39:59]  getting me to
[00:39:59 -> 00:40:01]  join things I might
[00:40:01 -> 00:40:03]  normally not.
[00:40:03 -> 00:40:05]  Oh, aren't younger brothers
[00:40:05 -> 00:40:07]  um, aren't
[00:40:07 -> 00:40:09]  younger brothers such- have a way
[00:40:09 -> 00:40:11]  like that with their older siblings?
[00:40:11 -> 00:40:13]  I know at least I do it with my brother all the
[00:40:13 -> 00:40:15]  time. And he gives-
[00:40:15 -> 00:40:17]  makes, uh, you know, gives-
[00:40:17 -> 00:40:19]  gives a chuckle.
[00:40:19 -> 00:40:21]  And he goes, indeed.
[00:40:21 -> 00:40:23]  Hmm.
[00:40:23 -> 00:40:25]  Well, you've filled out a lot
[00:40:25 -> 00:40:27]  more since the last time I saw you.
[00:40:27 -> 00:40:32]  Hmm.
[00:40:32 -> 00:40:34]  Well, thank you.
[00:40:34 -> 00:40:36]  Hmm. How have you been?
[00:40:36 -> 00:40:40]  Well,
[00:40:40 -> 00:40:42]  you did-
[00:40:42 -> 00:40:47]  I think there's some chemistry here.
[00:40:47 -> 00:40:49]  Haha, wait.
[00:40:49 -> 00:40:51]  Wait.
[00:40:51 -> 00:40:53]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[00:40:53 -> 00:40:55]  wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[00:40:55 -> 00:41:00]  wait, wait, wait, wait. What?
[00:41:00 -> 00:41:02]  What? I'm waiting.
[00:41:02 -> 00:41:04]  No, no, no, I'm joking, I'm joking.
[00:41:04 -> 00:41:06]  Um. That was Alex.
[00:41:06 -> 00:41:08]  Well, the last time
[00:41:08 -> 00:41:10]  I saw you at a party, um,
[00:41:10 -> 00:41:12]  you left so abruptly.
[00:41:12 -> 00:41:14]  It was unfortunate.
[00:41:14 -> 00:41:16]  I was- I was hoping
[00:41:16 -> 00:41:18]  to invite you to an afterparty.
[00:41:18 -> 00:41:20]  Are you going to stay longer this time?
[00:41:20 -> 00:41:22]  Or will you just disappear again?
[00:41:22 -> 00:41:24]  Oh,
[00:41:24 -> 00:41:26]  I-
[00:41:26 -> 00:41:28]  I do recall
[00:41:28 -> 00:41:30]  that
[00:41:30 -> 00:41:32]  it- I'm not very used
[00:41:32 -> 00:41:34]  to-
[00:41:34 -> 00:41:36]  despite my upbringing, it's never
[00:41:36 -> 00:41:38]  really been my cup of tea.
[00:41:38 -> 00:41:42]  These parties, but
[00:41:42 -> 00:41:44]  my younger brother has,
[00:41:44 -> 00:41:46]  as you mentioned, convinced me to
[00:41:46 -> 00:41:48]  stay, and so yes, I will be here.
[00:41:50 -> 00:41:52]  Well, then-
[00:41:52 -> 00:41:54]  I won't disappear, as you say.
[00:41:54 -> 00:41:56]  Don't make yourself the stranger.
[00:41:56 -> 00:41:58]  I'll keep that in mind.
[00:41:58 -> 00:42:00]  And he walks away, and he
[00:42:00 -> 00:42:02]  just, like, slides his hand on your shoulder
[00:42:02 -> 00:42:04]  as he walks away.
[00:42:04 -> 00:42:06]  I- I do-
[00:42:06 -> 00:42:08]  I just- you know, I don't- I don't,
[00:42:08 -> 00:42:10]  like, I don't
[00:42:10 -> 00:42:12]  freeze up. I stay relaxed.
[00:42:12 -> 00:42:14]  You know?
[00:42:14 -> 00:42:17]  But I don't respond.
[00:42:17 -> 00:42:19]  Who is he talking to again?
[00:42:19 -> 00:42:21]  Donathan Reeves just made a move on him.
[00:42:21 -> 00:42:23]  Okay.
[00:42:23 -> 00:42:25]  Dang, Donathan.
[00:42:25 -> 00:42:27]  I mean, Donathan's a slut.
[00:42:29 -> 00:42:31]  There's a freebie from me.
[00:42:35 -> 00:42:37]  Isn't Donathan
[00:42:37 -> 00:42:39]  banging the Duke?
[00:42:39 -> 00:42:41]  Yeah.
[00:42:41 -> 00:42:43]  Wow.
[00:42:45 -> 00:42:47]  The Ducal ball.
[00:42:47 -> 00:42:49]  Oh, man. Oh, man.
[00:42:49 -> 00:42:51]  You don't know what happened.
[00:42:51 -> 00:42:53]  Is the Duke a cook?
[00:42:53 -> 00:42:55]  Is this possible?
[00:42:55 -> 00:42:57]  Or-
[00:42:57 -> 00:42:59]  Nix is just- Nix is just
[00:42:59 -> 00:43:01]  thinking, like, I gotta not
[00:43:01 -> 00:43:03]  be so mis- I think the
[00:43:03 -> 00:43:05]  mystery, the mysterious vibes were
[00:43:05 -> 00:43:07]  a little too strong.
[00:43:07 -> 00:43:09]  Um,
[00:43:09 -> 00:43:11]  yeah, so, um,
[00:43:11 -> 00:43:13]  let- let's turn-
[00:43:13 -> 00:43:15]  Witty, are you still just, like, dancing
[00:43:15 -> 00:43:17]  around, or-
[00:43:17 -> 00:43:19]  Yeah, so I'm- I'm- I'm dancing, and I- I see,
[00:43:19 -> 00:43:21]  like, there's- there's a girl that's obviously
[00:43:21 -> 00:43:23]  staring at me with, like,
[00:43:23 -> 00:43:25]  you know, she's
[00:43:25 -> 00:43:27]  wondering what the hell I'm doing, and, like, you know,
[00:43:27 -> 00:43:29]  they're- they're looking at me and I- and
[00:43:29 -> 00:43:31]  whispering, but I- I take it, like,
[00:43:31 -> 00:43:33]  that she's, like, interested. So
[00:43:33 -> 00:43:35]  I kinda, like, mosey out
[00:43:35 -> 00:43:37]  of the dance, like, just towards
[00:43:37 -> 00:43:39]  uh, a girl.
[00:43:39 -> 00:43:41]  And kind of, I'm, like, shrugging my eyebrows at her
[00:43:41 -> 00:43:43]  as I come.
[00:43:43 -> 00:43:45]  Um, yeah. So, yeah,
[00:43:45 -> 00:43:47]  um, I- I'll
[00:43:47 -> 00:43:49]  say she has, like, this
[00:43:49 -> 00:43:51]  blonde
[00:43:51 -> 00:43:53]  updo, like,
[00:43:53 -> 00:43:55]  like, very high,
[00:43:55 -> 00:43:57]  high-collared
[00:43:57 -> 00:43:59]  kind of
[00:43:59 -> 00:44:01]  rosy dress frills,
[00:44:01 -> 00:44:03]  um, fan,
[00:44:03 -> 00:44:05]  and when you do that,
[00:44:05 -> 00:44:07]  she, um, she tries
[00:44:07 -> 00:44:09]  to, like, kind of- she-
[00:44:09 -> 00:44:11]  makes a gesture, like,
[00:44:11 -> 00:44:13]  kind of
[00:44:13 -> 00:44:15]  mow,
[00:44:15 -> 00:44:17]  kind of- just with the fan, kind of, like,
[00:44:17 -> 00:44:19]  one of those port
[00:44:19 -> 00:44:21]  kind of signals being, like,
[00:44:21 -> 00:44:23]  not interested,
[00:44:23 -> 00:44:25]  um, do you still-
[00:44:25 -> 00:44:27]  how does Witty take, uh, like-
[00:44:27 -> 00:44:29]  I pivot to the girl right next to me.
[00:44:29 -> 00:44:31]  Like,
[00:44:31 -> 00:44:33]  not even- not even, like,
[00:44:33 -> 00:44:35]  notice, I just immediately
[00:44:35 -> 00:44:37]  target into the next- the next person.
[00:44:37 -> 00:44:39]  You see the kind of
[00:44:39 -> 00:44:41]  all- she does the same, too, and they all kind of-
[00:44:41 -> 00:44:43]  at first they were watching the dance floor,
[00:44:43 -> 00:44:45]  now they're all turning in, like, a closed
[00:44:45 -> 00:44:47]  circle.
[00:44:47 -> 00:44:49]  Uh, yeah, so I'm just gonna, like, do a little spin move, and then,
[00:44:49 -> 00:44:51]  uh, you know, just keep-
[00:44:51 -> 00:44:53]  keep going, I guess.
[00:44:53 -> 00:44:55]  Are you just
[00:44:55 -> 00:44:57]  trying to take off one?
[00:44:57 -> 00:44:59]  Yeah, yeah, I'm just- I'm testing the
[00:44:59 -> 00:45:01]  waters, uh,
[00:45:01 -> 00:45:03]  with- with my eyes,
[00:45:03 -> 00:45:05]  really, um, and,
[00:45:05 -> 00:45:07]  uh, looking for somebody to
[00:45:07 -> 00:45:09]  talk to, really, um, at this point.
[00:45:09 -> 00:45:11]  Because, uh, I've just-
[00:45:11 -> 00:45:13]  I've- I've been starved of
[00:45:13 -> 00:45:15]  socialization with nobles since I
[00:45:15 -> 00:45:17]  left, uh,
[00:45:17 -> 00:45:19]  Vasilia?
[00:45:19 -> 00:45:21]  Is that it? Uh-
[00:45:21 -> 00:45:23]  Yeah, and would you-
[00:45:23 -> 00:45:25]  are you now, like,
[00:45:25 -> 00:45:27]  are you approaching more
[00:45:27 -> 00:45:29]  like, uh,
[00:45:29 -> 00:45:31]  obviously you're trying to flirt with the girls,
[00:45:31 -> 00:45:33]  but, like, are you trying to flirt with the guys, too?
[00:45:33 -> 00:45:35]  Uh, I'm-
[00:45:35 -> 00:45:37]  I'm looking both ways, uh,
[00:45:37 -> 00:45:39]  and I'm also- I'm also
[00:45:39 -> 00:45:41]  eyeing some slightly older- older,
[00:45:41 -> 00:45:43]  uh, women.
[00:45:43 -> 00:45:45]  Oh, okay, yeah, you're non-discriminating.
[00:45:45 -> 00:45:47]  So, like, just to be clear,
[00:45:47 -> 00:45:49]  the intent is, like, flirtatious with everyone.
[00:45:49 -> 00:45:51]  Flirt- yeah, flirt- flirtatious
[00:45:51 -> 00:45:53]  for sure. Uh, okay.
[00:45:53 -> 00:45:55]  And- and the types I'm looking at are, you know,
[00:45:55 -> 00:45:57]  uh, young and-
[00:45:57 -> 00:45:59]  young men and women, and
[00:45:59 -> 00:46:01]  older women.
[00:46:01 -> 00:46:03]  Okay. Yeah, there is, like, an
[00:46:03 -> 00:46:05]  old- actually,
[00:46:05 -> 00:46:07]  you see Lady, uh, Jacinta,
[00:46:07 -> 00:46:09]  who is
[00:46:09 -> 00:46:11]  who you haven't met.
[00:46:11 -> 00:46:13]  Um, yeah, there's this older
[00:46:13 -> 00:46:15]  lady, um,
[00:46:15 -> 00:46:17]  that, uh,
[00:46:17 -> 00:46:19]  kind of, like, yeah, she's, like,
[00:46:19 -> 00:46:21]  she doesn't, like, do anything
[00:46:21 -> 00:46:23]  obvious to shoo you away or anything,
[00:46:23 -> 00:46:25]  kind of just welcomes it, and
[00:46:25 -> 00:46:27]  maybe even a little, like, plays
[00:46:27 -> 00:46:29]  a bit shy with the fan
[00:46:29 -> 00:46:31]  hiding behind.
[00:46:31 -> 00:46:33]  Perfect. Um, so yeah,
[00:46:33 -> 00:46:35]  I'm gonna- I'm gonna make my way there, and,
[00:46:35 -> 00:46:37]  um, I'm gonna, like,
[00:46:37 -> 00:46:39]  I'm gonna start
[00:46:39 -> 00:46:41]  out with, like, a ridiculous humble brag
[00:46:41 -> 00:46:43]  of some sort. Um,
[00:46:43 -> 00:46:45]  Oh, man. And,
[00:46:45 -> 00:46:47]  uh,
[00:46:47 -> 00:46:49]  so I'm gonna walk up and
[00:46:49 -> 00:46:58]  say, uh, oh, no,
[00:46:58 -> 00:47:00]  okay, um,
[00:47:00 -> 00:47:02]  I'm gonna- I'm gonna walk up and bow
[00:47:02 -> 00:47:04]  and- and take off
[00:47:04 -> 00:47:06]  my hat, um,
[00:47:06 -> 00:47:08]  and, uh,
[00:47:08 -> 00:47:10]  and just say, uh,
[00:47:10 -> 00:47:12]  Whitaker the Six,
[00:47:12 -> 00:47:14]  how do you do?
[00:47:14 -> 00:47:16]  And, like, try to take- take her hand, maybe?
[00:47:16 -> 00:47:18]  To give it a little- Yeah.
[00:47:18 -> 00:47:20]  Uh, and she goes, Lady Jacinta,
[00:47:20 -> 00:47:22]  um,
[00:47:22 -> 00:47:24]  I did see upon entrance you
[00:47:24 -> 00:47:26]  knew, uh, the Viscount
[00:47:26 -> 00:47:28]  Reeves. Um,
[00:47:28 -> 00:47:30]  I'm friends with his- I
[00:47:30 -> 00:47:32]  was friends with his mother, and
[00:47:32 -> 00:47:34]  um, I do live,
[00:47:34 -> 00:47:36]  uh, nearby his quarters
[00:47:36 -> 00:47:38]  in the city. Um,
[00:47:38 -> 00:47:40]  how do you know,
[00:47:40 -> 00:47:42]  um, Director Reeves
[00:47:42 -> 00:47:44]  as he prefers it?
[00:47:44 -> 00:47:46]  Oh. Oh, our families go
[00:47:46 -> 00:47:48]  way back. Oh,
[00:47:48 -> 00:47:50]  oh, I- I suppose. I just-
[00:47:50 -> 00:47:52]  Whitaker, wait.
[00:47:52 -> 00:47:54]  Hmm.
[00:47:54 -> 00:47:56]  Wait, what- did you say your dad's name
[00:47:56 -> 00:47:58]  again was?
[00:47:58 -> 00:48:02]  Uh, did- did-
[00:48:02 -> 00:48:04]  Or did you- I- I- I thought you
[00:48:04 -> 00:48:06]  did. I can't remember. That's why.
[00:48:06 -> 00:48:08]  If there's not, that's fine.
[00:48:08 -> 00:48:10]  Um,
[00:48:10 -> 00:48:12]  uh, should we just go- Arthur?
[00:48:12 -> 00:48:14]  Sure.
[00:48:14 -> 00:48:16]  Um, oh,
[00:48:16 -> 00:48:18]  oh, are you
[00:48:18 -> 00:48:20]  part of Arthur's brood?
[00:48:20 -> 00:48:22]  Oh, yes, yes.
[00:48:22 -> 00:48:24]  I'm one of- I'm- I'm his
[00:48:24 -> 00:48:26]  youngest son.
[00:48:26 -> 00:48:28]  Oh, oh, yes, yes. Um,
[00:48:28 -> 00:48:30]  I- I've never, um,
[00:48:30 -> 00:48:32]  I- I- it was
[00:48:32 -> 00:48:34]  different circles than the Whitmans, but
[00:48:34 -> 00:48:36]  I did hear about
[00:48:36 -> 00:48:38]  you- how fruitful
[00:48:38 -> 00:48:40]  your family is.
[00:48:40 -> 00:48:42]  Oh, absolutely. Um,
[00:48:42 -> 00:48:44]  I've, uh, and this is where I'm gonna, like,
[00:48:44 -> 00:48:46]  humble brag for a second. Um,
[00:48:46 -> 00:48:48]  I've been- I've been so well off, I've even
[00:48:48 -> 00:48:50]  been able to hire a new- a new
[00:48:50 -> 00:48:52]  servant recently. Oh,
[00:48:52 -> 00:48:54]  a new servant? New-
[00:48:54 -> 00:48:56]  another servant?
[00:48:56 -> 00:48:58]  Or- Well, uh,
[00:48:58 -> 00:49:00]  an upgrade. An upgrade.
[00:49:00 -> 00:49:02]  Oh. Um, and I only- I only
[00:49:02 -> 00:49:04]  have to pay him 20 gold a month.
[00:49:04 -> 00:49:06]  It's, uh, a great deal.
[00:49:06 -> 00:49:12]  20 gold?
[00:49:12 -> 00:49:14]  Yeah. My sweet
[00:49:14 -> 00:49:16]  child, you are being highway robbed.
[00:49:18 -> 00:49:20]  Oh, no, he's worth it. When- when- when you-
[00:49:20 -> 00:49:22]  when you would meet him, you would- you would know he's- he's
[00:49:22 -> 00:49:24]  worth it. His- his ethnic
[00:49:24 -> 00:49:26]  food is fantastic.
[00:49:26 -> 00:49:28]  Not to be
[00:49:28 -> 00:49:30]  uncouth, as manners
[00:49:30 -> 00:49:32]  while business interactions do
[00:49:32 -> 00:49:34]  occur in these balls,
[00:49:34 -> 00:49:36]  we usually don't talk about the mundane of
[00:49:36 -> 00:49:38]  housework, but my child,
[00:49:38 -> 00:49:40]  even a good servant,
[00:49:40 -> 00:49:42]  is barely worth gold a month.
[00:49:42 -> 00:49:46]  Interesting.
[00:49:48 -> 00:49:52]  Uh,
[00:49:52 -> 00:49:54]  okay, I'm just gonna change the subject.
[00:49:54 -> 00:49:56]  Um, I'm gonna say
[00:49:56 -> 00:49:58]  what, uh, you look- you- you look
[00:49:58 -> 00:50:00]  wonderful today. Who are you wearing?
[00:50:00 -> 00:50:02]  Oh, it's fashion,
[00:50:02 -> 00:50:04]  I think.
[00:50:04 -> 00:50:06]  Who are you wearing?
[00:50:06 -> 00:50:08]  The blood of my head.
[00:50:08 -> 00:50:10]  Oh,
[00:50:10 -> 00:50:12]  this was just something that,
[00:50:12 -> 00:50:14]  um, I heard
[00:50:14 -> 00:50:16]  Lucinda, one of, uh,
[00:50:16 -> 00:50:18]  weaves and bobs
[00:50:18 -> 00:50:20]  up on the golden
[00:50:20 -> 00:50:22]  arch. Um,
[00:50:22 -> 00:50:24]  don't know if you have the opportunity to go,
[00:50:24 -> 00:50:26]  but Lucinda there, she does
[00:50:26 -> 00:50:28]  all. And, like, I will say
[00:50:28 -> 00:50:30]  to anyone looking, her looks
[00:50:30 -> 00:50:32]  are dated. Like, kind of
[00:50:32 -> 00:50:34]  how an older lady
[00:50:34 -> 00:50:36]  would kind of stick to the fashions
[00:50:36 -> 00:50:39]  of her youth. Um,
[00:50:39 -> 00:50:41]  um, yes.
[00:50:41 -> 00:50:43]  She does a wonderful job, hasn't
[00:50:43 -> 00:50:45]  she?
[00:50:45 -> 00:50:47]  Absolutely.
[00:50:47 -> 00:50:49]  So, um, I saw you came
[00:50:49 -> 00:50:51]  in with a few gentlemen. I heard
[00:50:51 -> 00:50:53]  they were your, um, brothers?
[00:50:53 -> 00:50:55]  Um...
[00:50:55 -> 00:50:57]  Yes, brothers, uh, Whitaker
[00:50:57 -> 00:50:59]  three, four, and
[00:50:59 -> 00:51:01]  five joined me tonight.
[00:51:01 -> 00:51:03]  Oh, how enchanting.
[00:51:03 -> 00:51:05]  Um,
[00:51:05 -> 00:51:09]  so I,
[00:51:09 -> 00:51:11]  so, you're
[00:51:11 -> 00:51:13]  not attaché to anyone either
[00:51:13 -> 00:51:15]  tonight?
[00:51:15 -> 00:51:17]  Uh, I'm, you know,
[00:51:17 -> 00:51:19]  I'm rolling with the wind. I go
[00:51:19 -> 00:51:21]  where the flow takes me.
[00:51:21 -> 00:51:24]  And your dress is quite
[00:51:24 -> 00:51:26]  flowing right now.
[00:51:26 -> 00:51:30]  You,
[00:51:30 -> 00:51:32]  you see, like, she,
[00:51:32 -> 00:51:37]  she's like,
[00:51:37 -> 00:51:39]  roll insight, just
[00:51:39 -> 00:51:41]  for a quick second.
[00:51:41 -> 00:51:48]  Oh, yeah.
[00:51:48 -> 00:51:50]  She,
[00:51:50 -> 00:51:52]  you kind of see for a moment, like, she's a little
[00:51:52 -> 00:51:54]  taken aback by the obvious
[00:51:54 -> 00:51:56]  flirtation, kind of
[00:51:56 -> 00:51:58]  like,
[00:51:58 -> 00:52:00]  but, like, she's still game.
[00:52:00 -> 00:52:04]  Um, she's, she,
[00:52:04 -> 00:52:06]  um, in a moment
[00:52:06 -> 00:52:08]  of self-awareness that you did not earlier
[00:52:08 -> 00:52:10]  have, um,
[00:52:10 -> 00:52:12]  you kind of see that, like,
[00:52:12 -> 00:52:14]  she sees you as kind of, like,
[00:52:14 -> 00:52:16]  this young, naive,
[00:52:16 -> 00:52:18]  ripe-for-the-picking
[00:52:18 -> 00:52:20]  kind of
[00:52:20 -> 00:52:22]  thing. Um,
[00:52:22 -> 00:52:24]  and she's like,
[00:52:24 -> 00:52:26]  why, yes, um,
[00:52:26 -> 00:52:28]  not to be
[00:52:28 -> 00:52:30]  uncouth or anything,
[00:52:30 -> 00:52:32]  but
[00:52:32 -> 00:52:34]  with the right, uh,
[00:52:34 -> 00:52:36]  how would it be?
[00:52:36 -> 00:52:38]  With the right breeze,
[00:52:38 -> 00:52:40]  as it were, and gentle
[00:52:40 -> 00:52:42]  wind, many things become
[00:52:42 -> 00:52:44]  many tasks
[00:52:44 -> 00:52:46]  become much more simpler.
[00:52:46 -> 00:52:51]  Can I get you a drink?
[00:52:51 -> 00:52:53]  By, by
[00:52:53 -> 00:52:55]  all means.
[00:52:55 -> 00:52:57]  Then I'm gonna, like, uh, you know,
[00:52:57 -> 00:52:59]  bow very deeply
[00:52:59 -> 00:53:01]  and take off my hat and look up and, like,
[00:53:01 -> 00:53:03]  give a little wink and then turn around and
[00:53:03 -> 00:53:05]  head to the bar.
[00:53:05 -> 00:53:07]  Um, well, there's, it's more like
[00:53:07 -> 00:53:09]  servants kind of walking around with drinks.
[00:53:09 -> 00:53:11]  Uh, then I look
[00:53:11 -> 00:53:13]  around and, like, a servant's, like,
[00:53:13 -> 00:53:15]  walking by real quick and I just, like,
[00:53:15 -> 00:53:17]  snap two, two, uh,
[00:53:17 -> 00:53:19]  two champagne flutes, two flutes
[00:53:19 -> 00:53:21]  off of, off of it and,
[00:53:21 -> 00:53:23]  like,
[00:53:23 -> 00:53:25]  kind of try to do a little spin but probably, uh,
[00:53:25 -> 00:53:27]  spill a little bit but
[00:53:27 -> 00:53:29]  still kind of... Acrobatics!
[00:53:29 -> 00:53:31]  Yeah, acrobatics.
[00:53:31 -> 00:53:33]  I wanna do, I wanna do a spin.
[00:53:33 -> 00:53:37]  Yeah, you
[00:53:37 -> 00:53:39]  you don't spill any, you do, like,
[00:53:39 -> 00:53:41]  a nice cute little spin and she goes
[00:53:41 -> 00:53:43]  bravo and, uh, like, with
[00:53:43 -> 00:53:46]  her close hand she goes...
[00:53:46 -> 00:53:48]  I just, I, I give a little bow.
[00:53:48 -> 00:53:52]  Um,
[00:53:52 -> 00:53:54]  and, uh, ask her,
[00:53:54 -> 00:53:56]  um,
[00:53:56 -> 00:53:58]  do I, how much do I know about her at this point?
[00:53:58 -> 00:54:00]  Barely anything.
[00:54:00 -> 00:54:02]  But barely anything? So I, I,
[00:54:02 -> 00:54:04]  I ask her, uh,
[00:54:04 -> 00:54:06]  you know, who, who, who she is
[00:54:06 -> 00:54:08]  I guess? Or, like, who, who
[00:54:08 -> 00:54:10]  she's here with?
[00:54:10 -> 00:54:12]  Oh, no, I'm here on my
[00:54:12 -> 00:54:14]  own. Um,
[00:54:14 -> 00:54:18]  I, I've been a widow for a while,
[00:54:18 -> 00:54:20]  um,
[00:54:20 -> 00:54:22]  I'm a staple, at this point,
[00:54:22 -> 00:54:24]  I'm a staple to these events.
[00:54:24 -> 00:54:26]  As I mentioned, uh,
[00:54:26 -> 00:54:28]  I know, I know the reuse.
[00:54:28 -> 00:54:30]  I was friends with his mother,
[00:54:30 -> 00:54:32]  neighbor. I like to
[00:54:32 -> 00:54:34]  keep an eye on him and, you know,
[00:54:34 -> 00:54:36]  getting up there in my age,
[00:54:36 -> 00:54:38]  I do like these nice outings,
[00:54:38 -> 00:54:40]  seeing what the young blood
[00:54:40 -> 00:54:42]  is up to these days,
[00:54:42 -> 00:54:44]  and also, all the best
[00:54:44 -> 00:54:46]  gossip.
[00:54:46 -> 00:54:48]  Ooh. Well, uh,
[00:54:48 -> 00:54:50]  this young blood is pumpin',
[00:54:50 -> 00:54:52]  and loves to hear some gossip.
[00:54:58 -> 00:55:04]  This young blood pumpin'
[00:55:04 -> 00:55:06]  just got me. Killed
[00:55:06 -> 00:55:08]  me. Uh.
[00:55:08 -> 00:55:10]  What, what's, and I, I'm just gonna
[00:55:10 -> 00:55:12]  kinda lean in at the, with the little,
[00:55:12 -> 00:55:14]  like, sideways and say, like,
[00:55:14 -> 00:55:16]  what's, what's your juiciest?
[00:55:16 -> 00:55:21]  I'm gonna say the second thing that came
[00:55:21 -> 00:55:23]  to mind, not the first.
[00:55:25 -> 00:55:27]  Um,
[00:55:27 -> 00:55:29]  well, there's a lot of room
[00:55:29 -> 00:55:31]  that's flying around, uh,
[00:55:31 -> 00:55:33]  Her Grace Ophelia.
[00:55:33 -> 00:55:35]  Um, it seems
[00:55:35 -> 00:55:37]  that, you know,
[00:55:37 -> 00:55:39]  she's, she's returning from the
[00:55:39 -> 00:55:41]  Torchlight College.
[00:55:41 -> 00:55:43]  Um, probably expect,
[00:55:43 -> 00:55:45]  still no,
[00:55:45 -> 00:55:47]  she is at the age where she should be engaged,
[00:55:47 -> 00:55:49]  but no formal engagement
[00:55:49 -> 00:55:51]  yet, so.
[00:55:51 -> 00:55:53]  There's a lot of buzz about what's,
[00:55:53 -> 00:55:55]  what is the Duke's intent with
[00:55:55 -> 00:55:57]  his niece.
[00:55:57 -> 00:55:59]  We know she is the heir, but,
[00:55:59 -> 00:56:01]  um,
[00:56:01 -> 00:56:03]  as you may be aware,
[00:56:03 -> 00:56:05]  the Duke is not having any children
[00:56:05 -> 00:56:07]  anytime soon.
[00:56:07 -> 00:56:09]  Um, so, as the
[00:56:09 -> 00:56:11]  heir, um, as the chosen
[00:56:11 -> 00:56:13]  heir, she will be,
[00:56:13 -> 00:56:15]  um, expected to inherit, but
[00:56:17 -> 00:56:19]  we do, we are not quite sure
[00:56:19 -> 00:56:21]  on what her engagement will be,
[00:56:21 -> 00:56:23]  or should the Duke be as liberal with
[00:56:23 -> 00:56:25]  her as his
[00:56:25 -> 00:56:29]  parents were with him.
[00:56:29 -> 00:56:31]  But you're, you're already
[00:56:31 -> 00:56:33]  wealthy, right? You're already
[00:56:33 -> 00:56:35]  kind of, you're, you're, you've inherited
[00:56:35 -> 00:56:37]  your, your ex-husband's wealth.
[00:56:39 -> 00:56:41]  He wasn't an ex! Dear Albert
[00:56:41 -> 00:56:43]  died!
[00:56:43 -> 00:56:45]  Your past, past
[00:56:45 -> 00:56:47]  husband's wealth?
[00:56:47 -> 00:56:49]  Oh, oh, actually, he married
[00:56:49 -> 00:56:51]  into my wealth.
[00:56:51 -> 00:56:53]  Oh, wow. Well, a bird in the hands
[00:56:53 -> 00:56:55]  with, a bird in the hands with two in the
[00:56:55 -> 00:56:57]  bush, so.
[00:56:57 -> 00:56:59]  If anything, this family was
[00:56:59 -> 00:57:01]  on troubled times.
[00:57:01 -> 00:57:03]  Um,
[00:57:03 -> 00:57:05]  I adored him, I grew to
[00:57:05 -> 00:57:07]  love and adore him, but
[00:57:07 -> 00:57:09]  the marriage was arranged for
[00:57:09 -> 00:57:11]  financial benefits of his family.
[00:57:11 -> 00:57:13]  Um, and
[00:57:13 -> 00:57:15]  the connections of mine, but
[00:57:15 -> 00:57:17]  that's all in the past.
[00:57:17 -> 00:57:19]  Um,
[00:57:19 -> 00:57:21]  um, I will
[00:57:21 -> 00:57:23]  now switch
[00:57:23 -> 00:57:25]  over, uh, as she's, you guys
[00:57:25 -> 00:57:27]  are kind of flirting, she's giving you, like, the
[00:57:27 -> 00:57:29]  gossip, right? Like, it's little things
[00:57:29 -> 00:57:31]  here and there, nothing, like, there's
[00:57:31 -> 00:57:33]  not, like, she's here to get the gossip,
[00:57:33 -> 00:57:35]  so, like, um,
[00:57:35 -> 00:57:37]  even, I would say, even too, she kind of
[00:57:37 -> 00:57:39]  pulls, like, she's intentionally
[00:57:39 -> 00:57:41]  sometimes moving,
[00:57:41 -> 00:57:43]  um, kind of just to
[00:57:43 -> 00:57:45]  while talking, so
[00:57:45 -> 00:57:47]  you kind of notice this pattern
[00:57:47 -> 00:57:49]  occasionally she'll start talking
[00:57:49 -> 00:57:51]  almost like
[00:57:51 -> 00:57:53]  she's saying sensible things, but
[00:57:53 -> 00:57:55]  it's nothing high-stake, because
[00:57:55 -> 00:57:57]  like, she's kind of moving into
[00:57:57 -> 00:57:59]  eavesdrop, so, like, doing, like, the
[00:57:59 -> 00:58:01]  two-in-one, so kind of bringing the conversation
[00:58:01 -> 00:58:03]  level down.
[00:58:03 -> 00:58:05]  Like, kind of slightly, slightly
[00:58:05 -> 00:58:07]  meandering through the area. Yeah,
[00:58:07 -> 00:58:09]  yeah, and, like, you know,
[00:58:09 -> 00:58:11]  slowing down sometimes, like,
[00:58:11 -> 00:58:13]  uh, she is very much taking
[00:58:13 -> 00:58:15]  lead, setting,
[00:58:15 -> 00:58:17]  setting the pace,
[00:58:17 -> 00:58:19]  as it were.
[00:58:19 -> 00:58:21]  Kind of
[00:58:21 -> 00:58:23]  just, like, listening in, kind
[00:58:23 -> 00:58:25]  of, and stuff.
[00:58:25 -> 00:58:27]  Um, we'll go, and now
[00:58:27 -> 00:58:29]  we're back, I do want to
[00:58:29 -> 00:58:31]  sense Avi is back, want to go back to
[00:58:31 -> 00:58:33]  brother number three, who wants to hit on Ophelia.
[00:58:33 -> 00:58:35]  Um, since you all
[00:58:35 -> 00:58:37]  want to hit on everyone, apparently.
[00:58:37 -> 00:58:39]  Or everyone wants to hit on you,
[00:58:39 -> 00:58:41]  it's very confusing.
[00:58:41 -> 00:58:43]  Um, yeah, so
[00:58:43 -> 00:58:45]  you got your dance around,
[00:58:45 -> 00:58:47]  you are near
[00:58:47 -> 00:58:49]  where, uh, her
[00:58:49 -> 00:58:51]  Grace Ophelia is.
[00:58:51 -> 00:58:53]  Um, can I take a moment
[00:58:53 -> 00:58:55]  to, uh, study
[00:58:55 -> 00:58:57]  her facial expressions, especially throughout
[00:58:57 -> 00:58:59]  the dance? Not only do I want to
[00:58:59 -> 00:59:01]  learn, is she
[00:59:01 -> 00:59:03]  has noticed me, but
[00:59:03 -> 00:59:05]  I also want to know, like, is she
[00:59:05 -> 00:59:07]  um, does she look bored,
[00:59:07 -> 00:59:09]  does she look uninterested,
[00:59:09 -> 00:59:11]  is she... That's an insight
[00:59:11 -> 00:59:13]  check. Yeah, yeah, let's try it.
[00:59:13 -> 00:59:15]  I'm gonna try it.
[00:59:15 -> 00:59:17]  Free roll!
[00:59:17 -> 00:59:19]  Oh, that's
[00:59:19 -> 00:59:21]  20! Ooh!
[00:59:21 -> 00:59:23]  So,
[00:59:23 -> 00:59:25]  what you see is
[00:59:25 -> 00:59:27]  someone who has trained all their life
[00:59:27 -> 00:59:29]  in nobility is
[00:59:29 -> 00:59:31]  able to
[00:59:31 -> 00:59:33]  kind of...
[00:59:33 -> 00:59:35]  What everyone else sees initially
[00:59:35 -> 00:59:37]  is, like, this lady
[00:59:37 -> 00:59:39]  who is this kind,
[00:59:39 -> 00:59:41]  gentle, kind of,
[00:59:41 -> 00:59:43]  you know, she is playing the role of heir,
[00:59:43 -> 00:59:45]  of niece, of just returning
[00:59:45 -> 00:59:47]  from torchlight college.
[00:59:47 -> 00:59:49]  Um, and there's this, like,
[00:59:49 -> 00:59:51]  uh, I don't want to say kindness, but, like,
[00:59:51 -> 00:59:53]  this polite interest, and
[00:59:53 -> 00:59:55]  affective, um,
[00:59:55 -> 00:59:57]  kind of warmness to her.
[00:59:57 -> 00:59:59]  But, like, you kind of
[00:59:59 -> 01:00:01]  see, beyond that, that
[01:00:01 -> 01:00:03]  she's very cold, calculating.
[01:00:03 -> 01:00:05]  Every,
[01:00:05 -> 01:00:07]  every person she's going to,
[01:00:07 -> 01:00:09]  there's intent behind there. There's
[01:00:09 -> 01:00:11]  the way her body's
[01:00:11 -> 01:00:13]  being held. It's
[01:00:13 -> 01:00:15]  very natural, but it's very,
[01:00:15 -> 01:00:17]  it's very
[01:00:17 -> 01:00:19]  performance. Like, this is
[01:00:19 -> 01:00:21]  in a lot of,
[01:00:21 -> 01:00:23]  kind of part of politicking and being
[01:00:23 -> 01:00:25]  in nobility is a performance.
[01:00:25 -> 01:00:27]  And I, I would say because
[01:00:27 -> 01:00:29]  you have, like, bard, like you,
[01:00:29 -> 01:00:31]  that's how you recognize it. You recognize it
[01:00:31 -> 01:00:33]  as, like, this performance
[01:00:33 -> 01:00:35]  being put on, kind of,
[01:00:35 -> 01:00:37]  as she has to, as she has to
[01:00:37 -> 01:00:39]  given her role, her position,
[01:00:39 -> 01:00:41]  and that. And so, it's very
[01:00:41 -> 01:00:43]  much, like,
[01:00:43 -> 01:00:45]  I hate the cliche, but the
[01:00:45 -> 01:00:47]  smile that doesn't reach her eyes, kind of
[01:00:47 -> 01:00:49]  thing. Um, but, like, it's
[01:00:49 -> 01:00:51]  kind of that, like, it is
[01:00:51 -> 01:00:53]  perfected.
[01:00:53 -> 01:00:55]  And it's just,
[01:00:55 -> 01:00:57]  me, I'll say something about the
[01:00:57 -> 01:00:59]  fact, like, bard and putting on performances,
[01:00:59 -> 01:01:01]  you kind of, you're able to, like, just
[01:01:01 -> 01:01:03]  clock it.
[01:01:03 -> 01:01:05]  And even she noticing
[01:01:05 -> 01:01:07]  you is a calculation.
[01:01:09 -> 01:01:11]  At the risk of pushing this Nat 20
[01:01:11 -> 01:01:13]  like a bit too much, can I,
[01:01:13 -> 01:01:15]  can I
[01:01:15 -> 01:01:17]  sense her, like, do I have any insight
[01:01:17 -> 01:01:19]  into her actual
[01:01:19 -> 01:01:21]  motivations, or if she,
[01:01:21 -> 01:01:23]  if she seems like a,
[01:01:23 -> 01:01:25]  like a, like a girl kind of trapped
[01:01:25 -> 01:01:27]  in this world, or if she
[01:01:27 -> 01:01:29]  seems like she's a part of the...
[01:01:29 -> 01:01:31]  Oh, 100%. She's in her
[01:01:31 -> 01:01:33]  element. Like...
[01:01:33 -> 01:01:35]  So, she, she, she, she
[01:01:35 -> 01:01:37]  revels in this right now. She's like... Oh, yeah.
[01:01:37 -> 01:01:39]  She revels in this. So, you
[01:01:39 -> 01:01:41]  don't know what her intent with you is,
[01:01:41 -> 01:01:43]  but her interest in you is
[01:01:43 -> 01:01:45]  a part of a calculation of something.
[01:01:45 -> 01:01:47]  You don't know what she's
[01:01:47 -> 01:01:49]  calculating. You know you're being
[01:01:49 -> 01:01:51]  factored in, and, like, whatever
[01:01:51 -> 01:01:53]  attention she'll give you will be factored
[01:01:53 -> 01:01:55]  in. Um, but, yeah, no,
[01:01:55 -> 01:01:57]  this is, this is not a performance
[01:01:57 -> 01:01:59]  that's like, ugh, like, I have to
[01:01:59 -> 01:02:01]  do this, and, like, it's draining her. It's,
[01:02:01 -> 01:02:03]  the calculation's not so much of
[01:02:03 -> 01:02:05]  she doesn't want to be there, it's she's
[01:02:05 -> 01:02:07]  setting up. Like, she's
[01:02:07 -> 01:02:09]  playing chess.
[01:02:09 -> 01:02:11]  She's setting up everything
[01:02:11 -> 01:02:13]  she needs to how
[01:02:13 -> 01:02:15]  she wants it. Um, and
[01:02:15 -> 01:02:17]  pro- and I'll, even with the Nat 20,
[01:02:17 -> 01:02:19]  I'll give it, like,
[01:02:19 -> 01:02:21]  this is probably one of the reasons she was chosen
[01:02:21 -> 01:02:23]  as heir to her uncle,
[01:02:23 -> 01:02:25]  is she has
[01:02:25 -> 01:02:27]  this cunningness that is...
[01:02:29 -> 01:02:31]  Like, had you not rolled a Nat 20, you would've
[01:02:31 -> 01:02:33]  not seen this.
[01:02:33 -> 01:02:35]  She would've played you like a
[01:02:35 -> 01:02:37]  fiddle,
[01:02:37 -> 01:02:39]  and you would've said, thank you, ma'am.
[01:02:40 -> 01:02:42]  Like, and you would've never realized.
[01:02:42 -> 01:02:47]  Very interesting.
[01:02:47 -> 01:02:49]  Um, is there, uh,
[01:02:49 -> 01:02:51]  is there, like,
[01:02:51 -> 01:02:53]  are people kind of, like, uh,
[01:02:53 -> 01:02:55]  I'm kind of traditioning a ball where people are
[01:02:55 -> 01:02:57]  like, introducing themselves
[01:02:57 -> 01:02:59]  in a line as they go on. Is there
[01:02:59 -> 01:03:01]  something like that forming around her, or?
[01:03:01 -> 01:03:03]  No, she's moving,
[01:03:03 -> 01:03:05]  like, people would've been maybe interested
[01:03:05 -> 01:03:07]  to introduce when they came in, but now this is,
[01:03:07 -> 01:03:09]  this is later into the ball where she's
[01:03:09 -> 01:03:11]  socializing. She's moving from group to
[01:03:11 -> 01:03:13]  group, kind of, as,
[01:03:13 -> 01:03:15]  like, on her own, not with her uncle,
[01:03:15 -> 01:03:17]  but, like, on her own, kind of.
[01:03:17 -> 01:03:19]  It's a mix of, like, catching
[01:03:19 -> 01:03:21]  up with, um,
[01:03:21 -> 01:03:23]  people she would know, kind of
[01:03:23 -> 01:03:25]  making the air, presence
[01:03:25 -> 01:03:27]  that the air is there, the air
[01:03:27 -> 01:03:29]  is accessible,
[01:03:29 -> 01:03:31]  um,
[01:03:31 -> 01:03:33]  and she's getting a feel for everything.
[01:03:33 -> 01:03:35]  Because, um, I would
[01:03:35 -> 01:03:37]  say you'd even get the sense she's calculating
[01:03:37 -> 01:03:39]  enough that despite anything she
[01:03:39 -> 01:03:41]  would've gotten, like, from her uncle,
[01:03:41 -> 01:03:43]  or even Donathan Reams, or whatever, she's
[01:03:43 -> 01:03:45]  doing her own assessment.
[01:03:45 -> 01:03:47]  This is, like,
[01:03:47 -> 01:03:49]  she's doing her own assessment of
[01:03:49 -> 01:03:51]  what is the political situation in
[01:03:51 -> 01:03:53]  Bastion City. Oh my god, this is
[01:03:53 -> 01:03:55]  so, I was, like, I was, like, imagining this
[01:03:55 -> 01:03:57]  woman as, like,
[01:03:57 -> 01:03:59]  she's stuck here, you know, like,
[01:03:59 -> 01:04:01]  she's just dealing, oh, this is so
[01:04:01 -> 01:04:03]  interesting, okay.
[01:04:03 -> 01:04:05]  She might be giving that affectation
[01:04:05 -> 01:04:07]  a bit,
[01:04:07 -> 01:04:09]  but it's her genuine,
[01:04:09 -> 01:04:11]  because they're not 20, her genuine thing
[01:04:11 -> 01:04:13]  is she is having a ball. So
[01:04:13 -> 01:04:15]  she is playing the role of a
[01:04:15 -> 01:04:17]  22-year-old who just came back from this
[01:04:17 -> 01:04:19]  college, whatever. Yeah,
[01:04:19 -> 01:04:21]  like, there is that bit of affective,
[01:04:21 -> 01:04:23]  like, oh, it's a bit stuffy, this formal
[01:04:23 -> 01:04:25]  thing, like, yeah, I just came back from
[01:04:25 -> 01:04:27]  college, maybe I was having a party there,
[01:04:27 -> 01:04:29]  who knows? Like, she
[01:04:29 -> 01:04:31]  is definitely,
[01:04:31 -> 01:04:33]  the cunningness is definitely downplayed,
[01:04:33 -> 01:04:35]  like, she's not showing that at all,
[01:04:35 -> 01:04:37]  she is showing a very different girl
[01:04:37 -> 01:04:39]  there, very much the girl that
[01:04:39 -> 01:04:41]  that
[01:04:41 -> 01:04:43]  Alara met
[01:04:43 -> 01:04:45]  is who she is
[01:04:45 -> 01:04:47]  affecting, but
[01:04:47 -> 01:04:49]  she has cold,
[01:04:49 -> 01:04:52]  like, this is all, like,
[01:04:52 -> 01:04:54]  not even, like, I wouldn't even say
[01:04:54 -> 01:04:56]  dead eye, there's, like, genuine, like, expression
[01:04:56 -> 01:04:58]  in her eyes, but, like, this is all, like,
[01:04:58 -> 01:05:00]  you know,
[01:05:00 -> 01:05:02]  like, she's
[01:05:02 -> 01:05:04]  paying attention, but, like, also, like,
[01:05:04 -> 01:05:06]  you can see a moment her eye flicks to the side,
[01:05:06 -> 01:05:08]  looking at different stuff, that's kind of where
[01:05:08 -> 01:05:10]  you caught her looking at you, too.
[01:05:10 -> 01:05:12]  And, like,
[01:05:12 -> 01:05:14]  you caught that, like, looking at you,
[01:05:14 -> 01:05:18]  making the note. I would say
[01:05:18 -> 01:05:20]  to the point, when you decide
[01:05:20 -> 01:05:22]  to break, she's suspiciously
[01:05:22 -> 01:05:24]  alone.
[01:05:24 -> 01:05:26]  I make my way
[01:05:26 -> 01:05:28]  Yeah, like, she intentionally
[01:05:28 -> 01:05:30]  kind of naturally moves
[01:05:30 -> 01:05:32]  away on her own, yeah, and she
[01:05:32 -> 01:05:34]  kind of, she goes,
[01:05:34 -> 01:05:36]  if I'm not mistaken, you are, would
[01:05:36 -> 01:05:38]  take her the fourth? Third?
[01:05:38 -> 01:05:40]  That was me fucking up.
[01:05:40 -> 01:05:42]  Not her.
[01:05:42 -> 01:05:44]  Yes, my
[01:05:44 -> 01:05:46]  lady, it's a
[01:05:46 -> 01:05:48]  absolute pleasure
[01:05:48 -> 01:05:50]  to meet you. My name is
[01:05:50 -> 01:05:52]  Lord Witty Whittaker III.
[01:05:54 -> 01:05:56]  And we are,
[01:05:56 -> 01:05:58]  I'm so excited that you
[01:05:58 -> 01:06:00]  have some, a moment away
[01:06:00 -> 01:06:02]  from the hustle and bustle.
[01:06:02 -> 01:06:04]  Yes, yes.
[01:06:04 -> 01:06:06]  So,
[01:06:06 -> 01:06:08]  you know how it is, your big return
[01:06:08 -> 01:06:10]  the ball, I have to do
[01:06:10 -> 01:06:12]  all the appropriate things,
[01:06:12 -> 01:06:14]  meet everyone,
[01:06:14 -> 01:06:16]  it's so, ever so draining.
[01:06:18 -> 01:06:20]  Um, really quick, I forgot, like,
[01:06:20 -> 01:06:23]  uh, I'm older
[01:06:23 -> 01:06:25]  than Witty, right? Because I'm the third
[01:06:25 -> 01:06:27]  brother. Yeah.
[01:06:27 -> 01:06:29]  You're older than Witty.
[01:06:29 -> 01:06:31]  I'm the old brother, does that mean I'm older?
[01:06:33 -> 01:06:35]  I'm trying to, like,
[01:06:35 -> 01:06:37]  it's not a generational thing.
[01:06:37 -> 01:06:39]  No, no, no, it was a weird
[01:06:39 -> 01:06:41]  It was a weird all
[01:06:41 -> 01:06:43]  same generation, different number.
[01:06:43 -> 01:06:45]  Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[01:06:45 -> 01:06:50]  Um,
[01:06:50 -> 01:06:52]  my dear lady, if I could
[01:06:52 -> 01:06:54]  be so bold,
[01:06:54 -> 01:06:57]  um, I noticed
[01:06:57 -> 01:06:59]  you across the room, and I have to say,
[01:06:59 -> 01:07:01]  you
[01:07:01 -> 01:07:03]  wear your role
[01:07:03 -> 01:07:05]  impeccably,
[01:07:05 -> 01:07:07]  Lady Ophelia.
[01:07:07 -> 01:07:09]  And I don't mean
[01:07:09 -> 01:07:11]  to say that you come across as
[01:07:11 -> 01:07:13]  fake or
[01:07:13 -> 01:07:15]  not, uh, genuine,
[01:07:15 -> 01:07:17]  I just, I just wanted
[01:07:17 -> 01:07:19]  to say I appreciate
[01:07:19 -> 01:07:21]  your discipline in the face
[01:07:21 -> 01:07:23]  of all these trials. You, you
[01:07:23 -> 01:07:25]  see, like, there's just
[01:07:25 -> 01:07:27]  the mashups for a second,
[01:07:27 -> 01:07:29]  and she looks to you.
[01:07:29 -> 01:07:31]  I knew you were far more interesting
[01:07:31 -> 01:07:33]  than, than you let on.
[01:07:33 -> 01:07:35]  So what,
[01:07:35 -> 01:07:37]  peacock for my
[01:07:37 -> 01:07:39]  attention, you're not
[01:07:39 -> 01:07:41]  the first little boy
[01:07:41 -> 01:07:49]  to try this.
[01:07:49 -> 01:07:51]  Like, can't, like,
[01:07:51 -> 01:07:53]  you get the feeling
[01:07:53 -> 01:07:55]  you are in a cage
[01:07:55 -> 01:07:57]  with a lioness.
[01:07:57 -> 01:08:01]  And you're the food. Right now.
[01:08:01 -> 01:08:03]  Like, when she drops the mask,
[01:08:03 -> 01:08:05]  that's, like, the presence she gives.
[01:08:05 -> 01:08:07]  And, like,
[01:08:07 -> 01:08:09]  here's the thing, the mask
[01:08:09 -> 01:08:11]  slips, as it were, but, like, to everyone
[01:08:11 -> 01:08:13]  else, and, like,
[01:08:13 -> 01:08:15]  she says it low enough so they can't hear
[01:08:15 -> 01:08:17]  it, for everyone else, she's giving
[01:08:17 -> 01:08:19]  the most, like, this is what's gonna be
[01:08:19 -> 01:08:21]  disjarring, the most pleasant face.
[01:08:21 -> 01:08:23]  When she says this.
[01:08:23 -> 01:08:29]  I've
[01:08:29 -> 01:08:31]  learned in my travels,
[01:08:31 -> 01:08:33]  those who
[01:08:33 -> 01:08:35]  appear too
[01:08:35 -> 01:08:37]  eager,
[01:08:37 -> 01:08:41]  they are usually the
[01:08:41 -> 01:08:43]  ones that I can handle.
[01:08:43 -> 01:08:45]  But
[01:08:45 -> 01:08:47]  the ones who
[01:08:47 -> 01:08:54]  hide their ambition through
[01:08:54 -> 01:08:56]  patience,
[01:08:56 -> 01:08:58]  now that is
[01:08:58 -> 01:09:00]  truly terrifying.
[01:09:00 -> 01:09:02]  But
[01:09:02 -> 01:09:04]  I appreciate
[01:09:04 -> 01:09:06]  your demeanor.
[01:09:06 -> 01:09:08]  And then, like, her voice back to
[01:09:08 -> 01:09:10]  the normal, she's like, what ambitions?
[01:09:10 -> 01:09:12]  I have it all. I am the heiress
[01:09:12 -> 01:09:14]  to the Grand Duchy. There's nothing
[01:09:14 -> 01:09:16]  to be more ambitious than me.
[01:09:16 -> 01:09:18]  I fail to understand you.
[01:09:18 -> 01:09:20]  But
[01:09:20 -> 01:09:22]  in all your travels,
[01:09:22 -> 01:09:24]  is that what have you been doing since
[01:09:24 -> 01:09:26]  your effective exile from your family?
[01:09:26 -> 01:09:30]  Um,
[01:09:30 -> 01:09:32]  I chose to walk away from my family
[01:09:32 -> 01:09:34]  in certain situations. Sometimes the other
[01:09:34 -> 01:09:36]  time, you have to strike your, your, carve out
[01:09:36 -> 01:09:38]  your own path.
[01:09:38 -> 01:09:40]  Yes, like you carved out the path in a young
[01:09:40 -> 01:09:42]  lady and caused a scandal.
[01:09:42 -> 01:09:44]  Are you looking for another
[01:09:44 -> 01:09:46]  scandal? Am I just
[01:09:46 -> 01:09:48]  another orn- is this just another ornament
[01:09:48 -> 01:09:50]  for you? Is that what it is?
[01:09:50 -> 01:09:52]  Another scandal?
[01:09:52 -> 01:09:54]  Make yourself relevant again?
[01:09:54 -> 01:09:56]  Not at all, my lady. Um,
[01:09:56 -> 01:09:58]  I don't look
[01:09:58 -> 01:10:00]  for scandals. I only look for connections.
[01:10:00 -> 01:10:04]  Hmm.
[01:10:04 -> 01:10:06]  And is that what you
[01:10:06 -> 01:10:08]  want right now? A connection
[01:10:08 -> 01:10:10]  to the heir
[01:10:10 -> 01:10:12]  of the- this Grand Duchy?
[01:10:12 -> 01:10:14]  To the Marchioness of Bastion City?
[01:10:14 -> 01:10:16]  Well, my lady, I think that's a-
[01:10:16 -> 01:10:18]  A connection? Don't you already have a connection
[01:10:18 -> 01:10:20]  with your brother here? What other
[01:10:20 -> 01:10:23]  connection would you need with the city?
[01:10:23 -> 01:10:25]  Silly old- just silly old me?
[01:10:27 -> 01:10:29]  Well, my lady,
[01:10:29 -> 01:10:31]  while you are
[01:10:31 -> 01:10:33]  um,
[01:10:33 -> 01:10:37]  while you are an amazing
[01:10:37 -> 01:10:39]  uh, catch, and
[01:10:39 -> 01:10:41]  I'm sure everyone- I'm sure
[01:10:41 -> 01:10:43]  you enjoy all the attention on you
[01:10:43 -> 01:10:45]  right now, um, I think it's
[01:10:45 -> 01:10:47]  a bit presumptuous, actually, to
[01:10:47 -> 01:10:49]  assume that
[01:10:49 -> 01:10:51]  um, I'm only interested in you
[01:10:51 -> 01:10:53]  for such trivial matters
[01:10:53 -> 01:10:55]  as
[01:10:55 -> 01:10:59]  um, as a fling.
[01:10:59 -> 01:11:01]  Oh, sweetie,
[01:11:01 -> 01:11:03]  darling,
[01:11:03 -> 01:11:05]  do not play above your class. You
[01:11:05 -> 01:11:09]  cannot punch this high.
[01:11:09 -> 01:11:11]  At most, you would be lucky
[01:11:11 -> 01:11:13]  if you could even see the-
[01:11:13 -> 01:11:15]  inside of my chambers.
[01:11:15 -> 01:11:19]  You know, when a lady, uh,
[01:11:19 -> 01:11:21]  when she's the first
[01:11:21 -> 01:11:23]  one to bring up her chambers,
[01:11:23 -> 01:11:29]  that usually bodes well for me.
[01:11:29 -> 01:11:31]  And I'm also the first one who can bring up the guards.
[01:11:31 -> 01:11:33]  I don't think that would bode well with you
[01:11:33 -> 01:11:35]  or your family, either.
[01:11:35 -> 01:11:37]  Would you want to cause such an embarrassment
[01:11:37 -> 01:11:41]  for your youngest brother?
[01:11:41 -> 01:11:43]  Um,
[01:11:43 -> 01:11:45]  not at all, not at all. Why don't we start
[01:11:45 -> 01:11:47]  with a simple dance first?
[01:11:47 -> 01:11:51]  I suppose so. You did
[01:11:51 -> 01:11:53]  show yourself on the floor.
[01:11:53 -> 01:11:55]  Um,
[01:11:55 -> 01:11:57]  I will say for now, like, uh,
[01:11:57 -> 01:11:59]  she kind of looks to you
[01:11:59 -> 01:12:01]  to lead the way, as you're supposed to.
[01:12:01 -> 01:12:03]  Um,
[01:12:03 -> 01:12:05]  and, uh,
[01:12:05 -> 01:12:07]  I'll let you guys have a little dance moment.
[01:12:07 -> 01:12:09]  Let's, um,
[01:12:09 -> 01:12:11]  let's go back to Alara and Ysidor.
[01:12:11 -> 01:12:13]  What are you two up to?
[01:12:13 -> 01:12:15]  What are you two- is that a cat?
[01:12:15 -> 01:12:17]  I saw two ears, Matt.
[01:12:17 -> 01:12:19]  Oh, yeah.
[01:12:19 -> 01:12:21]  Sorry. Bam.
[01:12:21 -> 01:12:23]  Cat tax. Is it a black cat?
[01:12:23 -> 01:12:25]  I can't see him.
[01:12:25 -> 01:12:27]  Oh, I mean, I have two black cats.
[01:12:27 -> 01:12:29]  Another voidling.
[01:12:29 -> 01:12:31]  Oh, bam, bam.
[01:12:31 -> 01:12:33]  Another voidling.
[01:12:33 -> 01:12:35]  Yeah, Pebbles is around somewhere, but
[01:12:35 -> 01:12:37]  Yeah.
[01:12:37 -> 01:12:39]  Um, sorry, I saw the ears.
[01:12:39 -> 01:12:41]  Um, so Ysidor
[01:12:41 -> 01:12:43]  and Alara
[01:12:43 -> 01:12:45]  Alara just took a sling
[01:12:45 -> 01:12:47]  of drink.
[01:12:47 -> 01:12:49]  She's just gonna ask,
[01:12:49 -> 01:12:51]  who else came?
[01:12:51 -> 01:12:55]  Uh,
[01:12:55 -> 01:12:57]  the whole gang is here.
[01:12:57 -> 01:12:59]  There is- and I look across the room
[01:12:59 -> 01:13:01]  to see if I can- can I see
[01:13:01 -> 01:13:03]  any of them?
[01:13:03 -> 01:13:05]  I'll allow another perception
[01:13:05 -> 01:13:07]  check.
[01:13:07 -> 01:13:09]  Different context now.
[01:13:09 -> 01:13:11]  Uh, perception.
[01:13:11 -> 01:13:17]  Well, eleven.
[01:13:17 -> 01:13:19]  Um,
[01:13:19 -> 01:13:21]  yeah, you don't,
[01:13:21 -> 01:13:23]  like, you go to point
[01:13:23 -> 01:13:25]  out, but, like,
[01:13:25 -> 01:13:27]  actually, eleven.
[01:13:27 -> 01:13:29]  Let's see, um,
[01:13:29 -> 01:13:31]  I would say you see-
[01:13:31 -> 01:13:33]  first, you see, kind of, Witty
[01:13:33 -> 01:13:35]  with Josenta, um,
[01:13:35 -> 01:13:37]  who you- you recognize her too,
[01:13:37 -> 01:13:39]  kind of, walking, um,
[01:13:39 -> 01:13:41]  with Witty, um,
[01:13:41 -> 01:13:43]  and, uh,
[01:13:43 -> 01:13:45]  I will say you just saw
[01:13:45 -> 01:13:47]  Baradun, or who Baradun's
[01:13:47 -> 01:13:49]  pretending to be, go in the dance
[01:13:49 -> 01:13:51]  floor with, uh, because I-
[01:13:51 -> 01:13:53]  honestly, I'm doing this more for comedy
[01:13:53 -> 01:13:55]  at this point, uh,
[01:13:55 -> 01:13:57]  you just see her-
[01:13:57 -> 01:13:59]  you see, uh, Din
[01:13:59 -> 01:14:01]  going on the dance floor with Ophelia,
[01:14:01 -> 01:14:03]  um,
[01:14:03 -> 01:14:05]  I will say you can't find,
[01:14:05 -> 01:14:07]  uh, Nyx, just because
[01:14:07 -> 01:14:09]  Nyx is being dark and broody in a corner.
[01:14:09 -> 01:14:11]  That sounds about right.
[01:14:11 -> 01:14:13]  So I point out, I go,
[01:14:13 -> 01:14:15]  um, Baradun
[01:14:15 -> 01:14:17]  seems to be dancing with that pretty lady,
[01:14:17 -> 01:14:19]  and he's number
[01:14:19 -> 01:14:21]  five?
[01:14:21 -> 01:14:23]  Fi- three? Five?
[01:14:23 -> 01:14:25]  Three. Of three.
[01:14:25 -> 01:14:27]  Wait, is Nibsator getting it wrong,
[01:14:27 -> 01:14:29]  or is it Mark getting it wrong?
[01:14:29 -> 01:14:31]  Honestly, both. So,
[01:14:31 -> 01:14:33]  I'll be like,
[01:14:33 -> 01:14:35]  I'm four,
[01:14:35 -> 01:14:37]  there's a one that's-
[01:14:37 -> 01:14:39]  You're five. I'm five.
[01:14:39 -> 01:14:41]  I knew this.
[01:14:41 -> 01:14:43]  But you said you're four?
[01:14:43 -> 01:14:45]  No, I'm five.
[01:14:45 -> 01:14:47]  Okay.
[01:14:47 -> 01:14:49]  I'm actually getting confused with these numbers.
[01:14:49 -> 01:14:51]  What's a five?
[01:14:51 -> 01:14:53]  I'm five.
[01:14:53 -> 01:14:55]  Baradun is
[01:14:55 -> 01:14:57]  either three or four.
[01:14:57 -> 01:14:59]  ...
[01:14:59 -> 01:15:01]  There's another one,
[01:15:01 -> 01:15:03]  that has a different number,
[01:15:03 -> 01:15:05]  and Nyx is also a number.
[01:15:05 -> 01:15:07]  Congratulations.
[01:15:07 -> 01:15:09]  Nailed it.
[01:15:09 -> 01:15:11]  Nailed it.
[01:15:11 -> 01:15:13]  Flawless, Vic. Flawless.
[01:15:13 -> 01:15:15]  I don't understand
[01:15:15 -> 01:15:17]  city folks. There's more names
[01:15:17 -> 01:15:19]  than just one to five.
[01:15:21 -> 01:15:25]  It's just that she just goes,
[01:15:25 -> 01:15:28]  so everyone's
[01:15:28 -> 01:15:30]  here?
[01:15:30 -> 01:15:32]  Oh no.
[01:15:32 -> 01:15:36]  Alara's worst nightmare.
[01:15:36 -> 01:15:38]  Yeah.
[01:15:38 -> 01:15:40]  Yeah, isn't it great?
[01:15:40 -> 01:15:43]  Oh, question.
[01:15:43 -> 01:15:45]  Alara, would you clock who the pretty lady is?
[01:15:45 -> 01:15:47]  Who Ysidor meant for pretty lady?
[01:15:47 -> 01:15:49]  Wait, hold on.
[01:15:49 -> 01:15:51]  When they
[01:15:51 -> 01:15:53]  came in, she probably wouldn't have
[01:15:53 -> 01:15:57]  paid attention to them, right?
[01:15:57 -> 01:15:59]  Yes, but when,
[01:15:59 -> 01:16:01]  who does Ysidor mean as pretty lady?
[01:16:01 -> 01:16:03]  Because you met Ophelia as well.
[01:16:03 -> 01:16:05]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:16:05 -> 01:16:07]  He just said pretty lady.
[01:16:07 -> 01:16:09]  Yeah.
[01:16:09 -> 01:16:11]  Did she point in the direction?
[01:16:11 -> 01:16:13]  Yeah, I have no
[01:16:13 -> 01:16:15]  etiquette, so I would definitely be pointing.
[01:16:15 -> 01:16:17]  Yeah, so
[01:16:17 -> 01:16:19]  you see him point
[01:16:19 -> 01:16:21]  at Ophelia, and he
[01:16:21 -> 01:16:23]  didn't just went with Ophelia.
[01:16:23 -> 01:16:25]  To that.
[01:16:25 -> 01:16:30]  So
[01:16:30 -> 01:16:34]  that spared him?
[01:16:34 -> 01:16:36]  Yeah. I mean, he seems to be
[01:16:36 -> 01:16:38]  getting along with
[01:16:38 -> 01:16:40]  whoever that is.
[01:16:40 -> 01:16:47]  She's just like,
[01:16:47 -> 01:16:49]  excuse me
[01:16:49 -> 01:16:51]  for a second.
[01:16:51 -> 01:16:53]  And she kind of makes her
[01:16:53 -> 01:16:55]  her way there.
[01:16:55 -> 01:16:57]  Are you interrupting
[01:16:57 -> 01:16:59]  the dance? Like, they're dancing.
[01:16:59 -> 01:17:01]  Like, they're in a whole
[01:17:01 -> 01:17:03]  dance thing.
[01:17:03 -> 01:17:05]  No, wait.
[01:17:05 -> 01:17:07]  So they're in the middle of the dance.
[01:17:07 -> 01:17:09]  Yeah, like, they're doing that courtly dance
[01:17:09 -> 01:17:11]  thing. Coordinated dances.
[01:17:11 -> 01:17:13]  Yeah.
[01:17:13 -> 01:17:15]  She wouldn't, or she would?
[01:17:15 -> 01:17:17]  No, she wouldn't.
[01:17:17 -> 01:17:19]  Not this kind, at least.
[01:17:19 -> 01:17:22]  No, she'll...
[01:17:22 -> 01:17:24]  But, like,
[01:17:24 -> 01:17:26]  based on what she's seen before,
[01:17:26 -> 01:17:28]  like, how does this... Is it, like, continuous
[01:17:28 -> 01:17:30]  dancing, or are there breaks between songs?
[01:17:30 -> 01:17:32]  There would be, like, after
[01:17:32 -> 01:17:34]  probably... The songs are
[01:17:34 -> 01:17:36]  longer because the dance is not, like, intense,
[01:17:36 -> 01:17:38]  right? You're not doing EDM rave stuff,
[01:17:38 -> 01:17:40]  right? But, like, there is,
[01:17:40 -> 01:17:42]  like, the song stops, there's
[01:17:42 -> 01:17:44]  a moment, another song picks up, and
[01:17:44 -> 01:17:46]  people, you know, switch partners,
[01:17:46 -> 01:17:48]  or, like, leave the dance floor during that,
[01:17:48 -> 01:17:50]  or something.
[01:17:50 -> 01:17:52]  She doesn't say, excuse me, yet. She
[01:17:52 -> 01:17:54]  would kind of
[01:17:54 -> 01:17:56]  nod, and kind of
[01:17:56 -> 01:17:58]  probably pay attention to when
[01:17:58 -> 01:18:00]  the song is ending.
[01:18:00 -> 01:18:02]  What else
[01:18:02 -> 01:18:04]  are you doing during that?
[01:18:04 -> 01:18:06]  While you're waiting, are you two still talking?
[01:18:06 -> 01:18:08]  Um, yeah.
[01:18:08 -> 01:18:10]  She'll probably just go, and...
[01:18:10 -> 01:18:12]  And where's Nyx?
[01:18:12 -> 01:18:14]  Oh, sorry, where's...
[01:18:14 -> 01:18:19]  Alexander?
[01:18:19 -> 01:18:23]  Maybe.
[01:18:23 -> 01:18:25]  I think that was the name.
[01:18:25 -> 01:18:27]  No, I don't remember if she knows that one. So she'll probably
[01:18:27 -> 01:18:29]  just kind of say, where's Nyx, in a whispered tone.
[01:18:29 -> 01:18:32]  To Isidore?
[01:18:32 -> 01:18:36]  Mhm.
[01:18:36 -> 01:18:38]  I look around the room.
[01:18:38 -> 01:18:40]  He's...
[01:18:40 -> 01:18:42]  He's somewhere. Somewhere around here.
[01:18:42 -> 01:18:46]  Do I see...
[01:18:46 -> 01:18:48]  Alara?
[01:18:48 -> 01:18:53]  Like, you were paying
[01:18:53 -> 01:18:55]  attention.
[01:18:55 -> 01:18:57]  Roll perception with advantage,
[01:18:57 -> 01:18:59]  just because you're being so slinky-slink.
[01:18:59 -> 01:19:01]  Okay.
[01:19:01 -> 01:19:03]  Let's see if I can do the slink. Slinky-slink.
[01:19:03 -> 01:19:05]  Let's see.
[01:19:05 -> 01:19:07]  Move this over here.
[01:19:07 -> 01:19:09]  Uh, what did you say? Perception?
[01:19:09 -> 01:19:11]  With advantage.
[01:19:11 -> 01:19:13]  You should be able to perceive. Wisdom's
[01:19:13 -> 01:19:15]  your second stat. I know, I know, I know.
[01:19:15 -> 01:19:17]  Slinky.
[01:19:17 -> 01:19:19]  Oh my god,
[01:19:19 -> 01:19:21]  I got a nat 1.
[01:19:21 -> 01:19:23]  But I got a 10,
[01:19:23 -> 01:19:25]  total. I got to... I got to...
[01:19:25 -> 01:19:27]  He does not want to be perceived,
[01:19:27 -> 01:19:29]  and he does not perceive either.
[01:19:31 -> 01:19:33]  Nyx is really
[01:19:33 -> 01:19:35]  bad at the thing he does.
[01:19:37 -> 01:19:39]  The dice are telling a story.
[01:19:39 -> 01:19:41]  Yeah, you kind of... I'd say
[01:19:41 -> 01:19:43]  you're a little unsettled by your interaction
[01:19:43 -> 01:19:45]  with Donathan.
[01:19:45 -> 01:19:47]  It's still like...
[01:19:47 -> 01:19:49]  Maybe not used to being hit on
[01:19:49 -> 01:19:51]  so hard.
[01:19:51 -> 01:19:53]  Especially when you're not yourself.
[01:19:53 -> 01:19:55]  Yeah.
[01:19:55 -> 01:19:57]  How do I see Alara?
[01:19:57 -> 01:19:59]  Yeah, you saw Alara at one point.
[01:19:59 -> 01:20:01]  You lost track of her.
[01:20:01 -> 01:20:03]  So I don't see her right now,
[01:20:03 -> 01:20:05]  is what I wanted to know.
[01:20:05 -> 01:20:07]  Yeah, like you're looking for her...
[01:20:07 -> 01:20:09]  Again, this is just from standing still.
[01:20:09 -> 01:20:11]  If you go to actively find her, you'll find her.
[01:20:11 -> 01:20:13]  Right, right, right. I just want to see if I could
[01:20:13 -> 01:20:15]  make eye contact with her, but no.
[01:20:15 -> 01:20:17]  Okay, I don't see her.
[01:20:17 -> 01:20:19]  Yeah, like if you're just standing here,
[01:20:19 -> 01:20:21]  scanning the crowd, no.
[01:20:21 -> 01:20:23]  But I'm not going to make you roll perception
[01:20:23 -> 01:20:25]  because it would just take time.
[01:20:25 -> 01:20:27]  Eventually you can find her in the crowd
[01:20:27 -> 01:20:29]  if she wasn't hiding.
[01:20:29 -> 01:20:31]  Unless Alara was actively trying to hide,
[01:20:31 -> 01:20:33]  then we'll get more...
[01:20:33 -> 01:20:35]  But I'm understanding this as you're just
[01:20:35 -> 01:20:37]  standing still, kind of like...
[01:20:37 -> 01:20:39]  Yep, that's it.
[01:20:39 -> 01:20:41]  Eyes sweep across.
[01:20:41 -> 01:20:43]  Yeah.
[01:20:43 -> 01:20:45]  You're still shaking.
[01:20:45 -> 01:20:48]  Yeah.
[01:20:48 -> 01:20:50]  Yeah.
[01:20:50 -> 01:20:52]  So I will say
[01:20:52 -> 01:20:54]  there is
[01:20:54 -> 01:20:56]  Din and Ophelia...
[01:20:56 -> 01:20:58]  You're able...
[01:20:58 -> 01:21:00]  I'll say during the dance, Ophelia was just
[01:21:00 -> 01:21:02]  very much the
[01:21:02 -> 01:21:04]  consummate court lady.
[01:21:04 -> 01:21:06]  The impeccable manners
[01:21:06 -> 01:21:08]  every step perfectly.
[01:21:08 -> 01:21:10]  Even
[01:21:10 -> 01:21:12]  you would see there was a moment...
[01:21:12 -> 01:21:14]  I'm not even going to say that.
[01:21:14 -> 01:21:16]  Never mind.
[01:21:16 -> 01:21:18]  Every step perfectly,
[01:21:18 -> 01:21:20]  in, out, back of her hand.
[01:21:20 -> 01:21:22]  She could be blindfolded and deafened
[01:21:22 -> 01:21:24]  and she would be still able to do
[01:21:24 -> 01:21:26]  this dance.
[01:21:26 -> 01:21:28]  Muscle memory for her.
[01:21:28 -> 01:21:30]  And the dance finishes.
[01:21:30 -> 01:21:32]  Actually, give me a performance.
[01:21:32 -> 01:21:34]  I want to see how well you did with this dance.
[01:21:34 -> 01:21:36]  Yeah.
[01:21:36 -> 01:21:38]  Let's see.
[01:21:38 -> 01:21:40]  You got a 16.
[01:21:40 -> 01:21:42]  Okay, yeah. You did well.
[01:21:42 -> 01:21:44]  Maybe she corrected...
[01:21:44 -> 01:21:46]  Even with your 16,
[01:21:46 -> 01:21:48]  she would do slight adjustments.
[01:21:48 -> 01:21:50]  Almost, but not to you,
[01:21:50 -> 01:21:52]  but kind of to make whatever...
[01:21:52 -> 01:21:54]  You're not getting anything wrong.
[01:21:54 -> 01:21:56]  Visibly, but
[01:21:56 -> 01:21:58]  you know your hand's supposed to
[01:21:58 -> 01:22:00]  be straight and you had it slightly angled?
[01:22:00 -> 01:22:02]  You know what I mean? It's so
[01:22:02 -> 01:22:04]  minute.
[01:22:04 -> 01:22:06]  And she's so regimented.
[01:22:06 -> 01:22:08]  And she goes...
[01:22:08 -> 01:22:10]  She knows it
[01:22:10 -> 01:22:12]  muscle memory perfect.
[01:22:12 -> 01:22:14]  And that's what I'm
[01:22:14 -> 01:22:16]  trying to say. You did very well.
[01:22:16 -> 01:22:18]  You weren't worth...
[01:22:18 -> 01:22:20]  You were probably better than the average.
[01:22:20 -> 01:22:22]  You were literally better than the average.
[01:22:22 -> 01:22:24]  But she is so...
[01:22:24 -> 01:22:26]  It's so muscle
[01:22:26 -> 01:22:28]  memory like this was trained for her from young
[01:22:28 -> 01:22:30]  that it doesn't...
[01:22:30 -> 01:22:32]  You were never going to be the same as her.
[01:22:32 -> 01:22:34]  And yeah.
[01:22:34 -> 01:22:36]  And she goes, not bad.
[01:22:36 -> 01:22:38]  Not bad. I guess...
[01:22:38 -> 01:22:40]  I guess a third son
[01:22:40 -> 01:22:42]  can dance.
[01:22:42 -> 01:22:44]  And you haven't been away for so long.
[01:22:44 -> 01:22:46]  And this is like you're off to the side
[01:22:46 -> 01:22:48]  talking. The dance is done.
[01:22:48 -> 01:22:50]  The next song is going to start in a few
[01:22:50 -> 01:22:52]  moments.
[01:22:52 -> 01:22:54]  Yeah. I think Ilar would wait for...
[01:22:54 -> 01:22:56]  the song to end and just go to
[01:22:56 -> 01:23:01]  save her.
[01:23:01 -> 01:23:03]  Yeah. So, Din,
[01:23:03 -> 01:23:05]  you would see a Lara approach.
[01:23:05 -> 01:23:07]  You see a familiar figure of a Lara approach.
[01:23:07 -> 01:23:09]  And you see Ophelia turn to a
[01:23:09 -> 01:23:11]  Oh.
[01:23:11 -> 01:23:13]  Sister Lara.
[01:23:13 -> 01:23:15]  One second. What was the
[01:23:15 -> 01:23:17]  proper term of her dress? Was she your...
[01:23:17 -> 01:23:19]  No. She's not your Grace yet. She's just...
[01:23:19 -> 01:23:21]  No. She's the Marchioness
[01:23:21 -> 01:23:23]  of
[01:23:23 -> 01:23:25]  Bastion City. So it would be
[01:23:25 -> 01:23:27]  Lady
[01:23:27 -> 01:23:29]  Ophelia.
[01:23:29 -> 01:23:33]  I love how I made this complicated
[01:23:33 -> 01:23:35]  naming system and I don't know it off by heart.
[01:23:35 -> 01:23:37]  And you're all like, fuck you,
[01:23:37 -> 01:23:39]  Bobby. Yeah, basically.
[01:23:39 -> 01:23:41]  She would be...
[01:23:41 -> 01:23:43]  Yeah, it would be My Lord or My Lady.
[01:23:43 -> 01:23:45]  And
[01:23:45 -> 01:23:47]  you could call her...
[01:23:47 -> 01:23:49]  Like, the first
[01:23:49 -> 01:23:51]  time would always be, you know, Marchioness
[01:23:51 -> 01:23:53]  of Bastion
[01:23:53 -> 01:23:55]  City. But yeah, it would just be
[01:23:55 -> 01:23:59]  My Lady.
[01:23:59 -> 01:24:01]  And...
[01:24:01 -> 01:24:03]  I so wanted
[01:24:03 -> 01:24:05]  to talk
[01:24:05 -> 01:24:07]  more with you.
[01:24:07 -> 01:24:09]  I only got a small window
[01:24:09 -> 01:24:11]  with Proctor Edward
[01:24:11 -> 01:24:13]  earlier. And
[01:24:13 -> 01:24:15]  I just wanted to hear more
[01:24:15 -> 01:24:22]  of your thoughts on...
[01:24:22 -> 01:24:24]  I would assume she knows the
[01:24:24 -> 01:24:26]  tree... I don't know.
[01:24:26 -> 01:24:28]  But something that...
[01:24:28 -> 01:24:30]  And she goes,
[01:24:30 -> 01:24:32]  Oh, yes, yes, yes. We did
[01:24:32 -> 01:24:34]  promise to do that. And how rude of me
[01:24:34 -> 01:24:36]  Sister
[01:24:36 -> 01:24:38]  O'Lara, this is
[01:24:40 -> 01:24:42]  Lord
[01:24:42 -> 01:24:44]  Whittaker Whitman III.
[01:24:44 -> 01:24:46]  His brother
[01:24:46 -> 01:24:48]  recently moved to the city
[01:24:48 -> 01:24:50]  and he so graciously attended.
[01:24:50 -> 01:24:52]  It has
[01:24:52 -> 01:24:54]  been a pleasure.
[01:24:54 -> 01:24:56]  But I do owe
[01:24:56 -> 01:24:58]  Sister O'Lara
[01:24:58 -> 01:25:00]  some girl time to
[01:25:00 -> 01:25:02]  as fellow devotees
[01:25:02 -> 01:25:04]  of Zuloja to speak
[01:25:04 -> 01:25:08]  on these matters.
[01:25:08 -> 01:25:10]  Thank you for the dance,
[01:25:10 -> 01:25:12]  Lady Ophelia.
[01:25:12 -> 01:25:14]  It was a pleasure.
[01:25:14 -> 01:25:16]  I suspect it won't
[01:25:16 -> 01:25:18]  be our last coupling.
[01:25:18 -> 01:25:20]  And then I'll
[01:25:20 -> 01:25:22]  leave, because I just got
[01:25:22 -> 01:25:24]  cockblocked by O'Lara.
[01:25:24 -> 01:25:26]  As he's
[01:25:26 -> 01:25:28]  leaving, like,
[01:25:28 -> 01:25:30]  you know, assuming they're at an angle where
[01:25:30 -> 01:25:32]  Ophelia wouldn't be able to see
[01:25:32 -> 01:25:34]  O'Lara, she just kind of glares at him like...
[01:25:34 -> 01:25:36]  Like...
[01:25:36 -> 01:25:38]  Oh,
[01:25:38 -> 01:25:40]  you know what?
[01:25:40 -> 01:25:42]  Do a little
[01:25:42 -> 01:25:47]  stealth. That's what you get.
[01:25:49 -> 01:25:55]  Let's see...
[01:25:57 -> 01:26:02]  Yeah, so
[01:26:02 -> 01:26:04]  she doesn't notice,
[01:26:04 -> 01:26:06]  and she goes,
[01:26:06 -> 01:26:08]  Yes, Sister
[01:26:08 -> 01:26:10]  O'Lara, it's so
[01:26:10 -> 01:26:12]  refreshing. I know
[01:26:12 -> 01:26:14]  Eulogians aren't, well,
[01:26:14 -> 01:26:16]  members of the Eulogia
[01:26:16 -> 01:26:18]  aren't often in these events,
[01:26:18 -> 01:26:20]  so it's very refreshing to see
[01:26:20 -> 01:26:22]  a fellow devoted
[01:26:22 -> 01:26:25]  Eulogian here.
[01:26:25 -> 01:26:27]  She just...
[01:26:27 -> 01:26:29]  And likewise,
[01:26:29 -> 01:26:33]  as
[01:26:33 -> 01:26:35]  interesting as it is to listen
[01:26:35 -> 01:26:37]  to all the seminaries
[01:26:37 -> 01:26:39]  and even back at the Priory
[01:26:39 -> 01:26:41]  in Arkos,
[01:26:41 -> 01:26:43]  I just
[01:26:43 -> 01:26:45]  have always wondered
[01:26:45 -> 01:26:47]  what it would be like to learn about
[01:26:47 -> 01:26:49]  the Light from such a different perspective.
[01:26:49 -> 01:26:53]  The teaching of the Light
[01:26:53 -> 01:26:55]  is universal.
[01:26:55 -> 01:26:57]  While each teacher is different,
[01:26:57 -> 01:26:59]  the story is the same,
[01:26:59 -> 01:27:01]  the truth is the same
[01:27:01 -> 01:27:03]  as the Eternal Light.
[01:27:03 -> 01:27:05]  It is unchanging.
[01:27:05 -> 01:27:07]  It is just how
[01:27:07 -> 01:27:09]  the stories sometimes are woven
[01:27:09 -> 01:27:12]  is different.
[01:27:12 -> 01:27:14]  O'Lara just slightly
[01:27:14 -> 01:27:16]  blushes and is like,
[01:27:16 -> 01:27:18]  Oh, that is so true.
[01:27:18 -> 01:27:20]  If I can be
[01:27:20 -> 01:27:22]  I mainly came
[01:27:22 -> 01:27:24]  right now because I was wondering
[01:27:24 -> 01:27:28]  if that man had been
[01:27:28 -> 01:27:30]  bothering you.
[01:27:30 -> 01:27:33]  Oh, so kind,
[01:27:33 -> 01:27:35]  Sister O'Lara.
[01:27:35 -> 01:27:37]  It often
[01:27:37 -> 01:27:39]  happens.
[01:27:41 -> 01:27:43]  Young noblemen
[01:27:43 -> 01:27:45]  often see a title
[01:27:45 -> 01:27:47]  and an opportunity and a chance.
[01:27:47 -> 01:27:49]  I do appreciate your kindness.
[01:27:51 -> 01:27:53]  When you know what they want, it's easy.
[01:27:53 -> 01:27:55]  It's easy to
[01:27:55 -> 01:27:57]  handle.
[01:27:57 -> 01:27:59]  As someone
[01:27:59 -> 01:28:01]  told me recently, those who hide
[01:28:01 -> 01:28:03]  their ambition make it much more difficult.
[01:28:03 -> 01:28:05]  But when their
[01:28:05 -> 01:28:07]  ambition is so plain
[01:28:07 -> 01:28:09]  and obvious to the Light,
[01:28:09 -> 01:28:11]  then
[01:28:11 -> 01:28:13]  they are
[01:28:13 -> 01:28:15]  easily handled.
[01:28:15 -> 01:28:17]  But I do appreciate the break.
[01:28:19 -> 01:28:21]  So he didn't say anything
[01:28:21 -> 01:28:23]  too weird or untoward?
[01:28:23 -> 01:28:25]  No more than any other young man
[01:28:25 -> 01:28:27]  of his station would.
[01:28:27 -> 01:28:29]  You see her, like, breathe out
[01:28:29 -> 01:28:31]  very relieved.
[01:28:31 -> 01:28:33]  I'm so glad to hear that.
[01:28:33 -> 01:28:35]  Oh, no need to be concerned.
[01:28:35 -> 01:28:37]  I do appreciate it, but
[01:28:37 -> 01:28:39]  this is not the first
[01:28:39 -> 01:28:41]  time, nor will it be the last, that I
[01:28:41 -> 01:28:43]  have had tutors,
[01:28:43 -> 01:28:45]  as it were, of his ilk.
[01:28:45 -> 01:28:47]  O'Lara just goes,
[01:28:47 -> 01:28:49]  Of course, I don't know what I was
[01:28:49 -> 01:28:51]  thinking. Someone as
[01:28:51 -> 01:28:53]  beautiful as you must have all this
[01:28:53 -> 01:28:55]  time.
[01:28:55 -> 01:28:57]  No need for flattery.
[01:28:57 -> 01:28:59]  I am sure you get your own
[01:28:59 -> 01:29:01]  tutors, even at the seminary.
[01:29:01 -> 01:29:03]  This is much deeper now.
[01:29:03 -> 01:29:05]  No, no, no.
[01:29:05 -> 01:29:07]  The Light,
[01:29:07 -> 01:29:09]  you know, the Light does include
[01:29:09 -> 01:29:11]  all kinds of love,
[01:29:11 -> 01:29:13]  as it were.
[01:29:13 -> 01:29:15]  You did not take
[01:29:15 -> 01:29:17]  any vows of chastity.
[01:29:17 -> 01:29:19]  That's not a thing, right?
[01:29:19 -> 01:29:21]  That's not required.
[01:29:21 -> 01:29:23]  It happens sometimes.
[01:29:23 -> 01:29:25]  Yeah, people could.
[01:29:25 -> 01:29:27]  I will put it this way.
[01:29:27 -> 01:29:29]  The implication is, if you want,
[01:29:29 -> 01:29:31]  you could, as part of your devotion.
[01:29:31 -> 01:29:33]  It is not required by anyone,
[01:29:33 -> 01:29:35]  though. It's just, some people
[01:29:35 -> 01:29:37]  like to do it.
[01:29:37 -> 01:29:39]  No, no, back
[01:29:39 -> 01:29:41]  in the Highlands, if
[01:29:41 -> 01:29:43]  the devout followed that tradition,
[01:29:43 -> 01:29:45]  it would have died out
[01:29:45 -> 01:29:47]  long ago.
[01:29:47 -> 01:29:49]  Oh, yes, of course, of course.
[01:29:49 -> 01:29:51]  It is rare still, but the Light does
[01:29:51 -> 01:29:53]  accommodate all. Some see that,
[01:29:53 -> 01:29:55]  as a path of worship.
[01:29:55 -> 01:29:57]  And who am I to
[01:29:57 -> 01:29:59]  disparage anyone who seeks the Light?
[01:30:01 -> 01:30:03]  Of course, nobody should
[01:30:03 -> 01:30:05]  disparage those who seek the Light.
[01:30:05 -> 01:30:07]  It is true that
[01:30:07 -> 01:30:09]  I have seen some people who
[01:30:09 -> 01:30:11]  try to
[01:30:13 -> 01:30:15]  use the Light to blind others.
[01:30:15 -> 01:30:19]  Ah, yes.
[01:30:19 -> 01:30:21]  Well, and that is always a danger.
[01:30:21 -> 01:30:23]  But that is not the Light,
[01:30:23 -> 01:30:25]  but just the false Light that they carry.
[01:30:25 -> 01:30:27]  That they carry their own
[01:30:27 -> 01:30:29]  false...
[01:30:31 -> 01:30:33]  She just kind of...
[01:30:33 -> 01:30:35]  And she looks up and she goes,
[01:30:35 -> 01:30:37]  much like those light crystals,
[01:30:37 -> 01:30:39]  many things can create Light,
[01:30:39 -> 01:30:41]  but they are not always the reflection
[01:30:41 -> 01:30:43]  of the Eternal Light.
[01:30:43 -> 01:30:45]  And sometimes people mistake
[01:30:45 -> 01:30:47]  that Light that they carry in their pocket
[01:30:47 -> 01:30:49]  as the Eternal Light and the Truth.
[01:30:49 -> 01:30:51]  Then...
[01:30:51 -> 01:30:53]  She kind of,
[01:30:53 -> 01:30:55]  out of almost reflex, just says,
[01:30:55 -> 01:30:57]  it's not fair.
[01:30:57 -> 01:30:59]  And then she covers her mouth quickly.
[01:30:59 -> 01:31:01]  Oh, yes.
[01:31:01 -> 01:31:03]  Yes, it is often
[01:31:03 -> 01:31:05]  not fair in this world.
[01:31:05 -> 01:31:07]  Oh, no, sorry.
[01:31:07 -> 01:31:09]  She interrupts a little, like,
[01:31:09 -> 01:31:11]  oh, no, no, sorry, I just meant...
[01:31:11 -> 01:31:13]  It just seems...
[01:31:13 -> 01:31:15]  I've studied my entire life,
[01:31:15 -> 01:31:17]  and you, who can do
[01:31:17 -> 01:31:19]  all these other things, already seem
[01:31:19 -> 01:31:21]  so far beyond me.
[01:31:21 -> 01:31:23]  How did you find the time to learn
[01:31:23 -> 01:31:25]  about the Light so deeply?
[01:31:25 -> 01:31:27]  I've done this since I was a child,
[01:31:27 -> 01:31:29]  and yet I feel like you have
[01:31:29 -> 01:31:31]  thirty years on you
[01:31:31 -> 01:31:33]  in terms of wisdom,
[01:31:33 -> 01:31:35]  or in terms of experience.
[01:31:37 -> 01:31:39]  If Sister Lara
[01:31:39 -> 01:31:41]  still was anyone else,
[01:31:41 -> 01:31:43]  I would accuse you of false flattery,
[01:31:43 -> 01:31:45]  but you seem so genuine.
[01:31:45 -> 01:31:47]  No, no,
[01:31:47 -> 01:31:49]  just much as expected of a lady
[01:31:49 -> 01:31:51]  of the court as an heir
[01:31:51 -> 01:31:53]  to a Grand Duchy.
[01:31:53 -> 01:31:55]  I must know
[01:31:55 -> 01:31:57]  all those
[01:31:57 -> 01:31:59]  who one day
[01:31:59 -> 01:32:01]  I will have a responsibility to,
[01:32:01 -> 01:32:03]  so must I know the Eulogia
[01:32:03 -> 01:32:05]  and the Eternal Light that guides us all.
[01:32:05 -> 01:32:08]  She looks down a bit
[01:32:08 -> 01:32:10]  and is like,
[01:32:10 -> 01:32:12]  that is such a heavy burden.
[01:32:12 -> 01:32:14]  She puts a gentle finger
[01:32:14 -> 01:32:16]  and lifts up your chin and goes,
[01:32:16 -> 01:32:18]  do not worry.
[01:32:18 -> 01:32:20]  She just freezes completely.
[01:32:20 -> 01:32:22]  Yeah, but it's like,
[01:32:22 -> 01:32:24]  I'd say it's like
[01:32:24 -> 01:32:26]  sisterly, like, and she's like,
[01:32:26 -> 01:32:28]  do not despair upon yourself.
[01:32:28 -> 01:32:30]  You are far more
[01:32:30 -> 01:32:32]  humble than
[01:32:32 -> 01:32:34]  you are far more humble
[01:32:34 -> 01:32:36]  than your actual abilities
[01:32:36 -> 01:32:38]  are. Do not despair.
[01:32:38 -> 01:32:40]  I see much of the
[01:32:40 -> 01:32:42]  light reflected in you.
[01:32:42 -> 01:32:44]  More so than most here.
[01:32:44 -> 01:32:46]  So do not despair.
[01:32:46 -> 01:32:48]  Do not diminish yourself.
[01:32:48 -> 01:32:50]  Do not diminish your own might.
[01:32:50 -> 01:32:52]  She's just
[01:32:52 -> 01:32:54]  completely speechless.
[01:32:54 -> 01:32:56]  Can't say anything. She's like,
[01:32:56 -> 01:32:58]  kind of shaking her head
[01:32:58 -> 01:33:00]  or nodding and she's like,
[01:33:00 -> 01:33:02]  she can't say anything.
[01:33:02 -> 01:33:04]  Thank you.
[01:33:04 -> 01:33:08]  I don't,
[01:33:08 -> 01:33:10]  I just don't know if that's true,
[01:33:10 -> 01:33:12]  but if
[01:33:12 -> 01:33:14]  you say so, surely there is
[01:33:14 -> 01:33:16]  a grain of truth in it.
[01:33:16 -> 01:33:18]  And
[01:33:18 -> 01:33:20]  I will say one last thing for unfortunately
[01:33:20 -> 01:33:22]  as much as I am enjoying this conversation,
[01:33:22 -> 01:33:24]  it does look like my uncle
[01:33:24 -> 01:33:26]  does need me. I will say
[01:33:26 -> 01:33:28]  this.
[01:33:28 -> 01:33:30]  You carry a reflection of the
[01:33:30 -> 01:33:32]  eternal light within you like we all do
[01:33:32 -> 01:33:34]  and do not let your own
[01:33:34 -> 01:33:36]  doubts cloud that
[01:33:36 -> 01:33:38]  and put shadows upon that
[01:33:38 -> 01:33:40]  light.
[01:33:40 -> 01:33:42]  I hope you are able to enjoy this evening.
[01:33:42 -> 01:33:44]  And she walks away.
[01:33:44 -> 01:33:46]  Well, I mean,
[01:33:46 -> 01:33:48]  you have a moment.
[01:33:48 -> 01:33:50]  She's going to walk away.
[01:33:50 -> 01:33:52]  She's just going to say,
[01:33:52 -> 01:33:54]  thank you so much.
[01:33:54 -> 01:33:56]  And she's just like,
[01:33:56 -> 01:33:58]  I know this is probably not the
[01:33:58 -> 01:34:00]  right protocol,
[01:34:00 -> 01:34:02]  but if you ever do
[01:34:02 -> 01:34:04]  need someone who is just a
[01:34:04 -> 01:34:06]  friend, I am here.
[01:34:06 -> 01:34:08]  I know
[01:34:08 -> 01:34:10]  you are far
[01:34:10 -> 01:34:12]  above me, but
[01:34:12 -> 01:34:14]  the light, no sorry, the
[01:34:14 -> 01:34:16]  loja teaches us that
[01:34:16 -> 01:34:18]  in the light all are equal
[01:34:18 -> 01:34:20]  and I
[01:34:20 -> 01:34:22]  just want you to know
[01:34:22 -> 01:34:24]  if you do need someone
[01:34:24 -> 01:34:26]  your age, not your age,
[01:34:26 -> 01:34:28]  yeah, someone
[01:34:28 -> 01:34:30]  Yeah.
[01:34:30 -> 01:34:32]  And she smiles,
[01:34:32 -> 01:34:34]  she gives you a little smile and says,
[01:34:34 -> 01:34:36]  a friend is, a true
[01:34:36 -> 01:34:38]  friend is a hard thing to find in this
[01:34:38 -> 01:34:40]  world, especially among
[01:34:40 -> 01:34:42]  this viper den.
[01:34:42 -> 01:34:44]  Maybe I'll take you up on that offer one day,
[01:34:44 -> 01:34:46]  Sister Lara.
[01:34:46 -> 01:34:48]  I know where to find you.
[01:34:48 -> 01:34:50]  I think she's like
[01:34:50 -> 01:34:52]  slightly blushing still and
[01:34:52 -> 01:34:54]  not lets her, but like
[01:34:54 -> 01:34:56]  watches her walk.
[01:34:56 -> 01:34:58]  Does Lara want to sleep with her too?
[01:34:58 -> 01:35:00]  No.
[01:35:00 -> 01:35:02]  Doesn't mean she can't have a crush.
[01:35:02 -> 01:35:04]  Yeah.
[01:35:04 -> 01:35:06]  Very girl crush energy.
[01:35:06 -> 01:35:08]  Huh?
[01:35:08 -> 01:35:10]  Very girl crush energy, Lara.
[01:35:10 -> 01:35:12]  That was the plan going in.
[01:35:12 -> 01:35:14]  It had nothing to do with it.
[01:35:14 -> 01:35:16]  Yeah.
[01:35:16 -> 01:35:19]  Baradun has a rival.
[01:35:19 -> 01:35:21]  Yeah, so
[01:35:21 -> 01:35:23]  Ophelia walks away towards
[01:35:23 -> 01:35:25]  her uncle
[01:35:25 -> 01:35:27]  and
[01:35:27 -> 01:35:29]  yeah, and Baradun,
[01:35:29 -> 01:35:31]  if you were paying attention, you see Ophelia
[01:35:31 -> 01:35:33]  walk away, looking towards
[01:35:33 -> 01:35:35]  going towards the Grand Duke.
[01:35:35 -> 01:35:37]  Lara's alone.
[01:35:37 -> 01:35:39]  Oh,
[01:35:39 -> 01:35:41]  yeah, let's go back to
[01:35:41 -> 01:35:43]  Witty. Witty,
[01:35:43 -> 01:35:45]  Jacinta, you've done the rounds
[01:35:45 -> 01:35:47]  a bit and Jacinta
[01:35:47 -> 01:35:49]  kind of looks, goes,
[01:35:49 -> 01:35:51]  well, you've been quite the
[01:35:51 -> 01:35:53]  companion tonight,
[01:35:53 -> 01:35:55]  Lord Witty.
[01:35:55 -> 01:35:57]  You as well,
[01:35:57 -> 01:35:59]  my lady.
[01:35:59 -> 01:36:01]  Well,
[01:36:01 -> 01:36:03]  the ball is almost
[01:36:03 -> 01:36:05]  over.
[01:36:05 -> 01:36:07]  You did say
[01:36:07 -> 01:36:09]  you go with the wind and I
[01:36:09 -> 01:36:11]  think the winds
[01:36:11 -> 01:36:13]  are blowing home.
[01:36:13 -> 01:36:18]  I would
[01:36:18 -> 01:36:22]  I would
[01:36:22 -> 01:36:24]  be honored to sail with you.
[01:36:24 -> 01:36:26]  These are like
[01:36:26 -> 01:36:28]  the worst fucking guns ever
[01:36:28 -> 01:36:30]  and I'm loving it.
[01:36:30 -> 01:36:32]  Well then.
[01:36:32 -> 01:36:34]  Well then.
[01:36:34 -> 01:36:36]  No.
[01:36:36 -> 01:36:38]  Fuck.
[01:36:38 -> 01:36:40]  Fuck.
[01:36:40 -> 01:36:49]  No.
[01:36:49 -> 01:36:51]  That's a message on all rules.
[01:36:51 -> 01:36:53]  Kidding.
[01:36:53 -> 01:36:55]  Yes, and
[01:36:55 -> 01:36:57]  she kind of guides you to the front
[01:36:57 -> 01:37:00]  and
[01:37:00 -> 01:37:02]  she's taking you home.
[01:37:02 -> 01:37:04]  Perfect.
[01:37:06 -> 01:37:08]  As I'm like
[01:37:08 -> 01:37:10]  walking out,
[01:37:10 -> 01:37:12]  I see
[01:37:12 -> 01:37:14]  I see
[01:37:14 -> 01:37:16]  I see Nix there.
[01:37:16 -> 01:37:18]  Is Nix here?
[01:37:18 -> 01:37:20]  Um
[01:37:20 -> 01:37:22]  I see
[01:37:22 -> 01:37:24]  I see Nix there and I just give him like
[01:37:24 -> 01:37:26]  two thumbs up.
[01:37:26 -> 01:37:28]  Yeah, someone
[01:37:28 -> 01:37:30]  at this point in the rolls
[01:37:30 -> 01:37:32]  I've been so bad for Nix.
[01:37:32 -> 01:37:34]  Yeah, someone finally notices Nix.
[01:37:34 -> 01:37:36]  Yeah, so
[01:37:36 -> 01:37:38]  I see Nix over there and I
[01:37:38 -> 01:37:40]  give him two thumbs up and
[01:37:40 -> 01:37:42]  I could like
[01:37:42 -> 01:37:47]  uh
[01:37:47 -> 01:37:49]  could I do a prestidigitation?
[01:37:49 -> 01:37:51]  On what?
[01:37:51 -> 01:37:53]  Like what are you doing?
[01:37:53 -> 01:39:36]  I'm gonna play like
[01:39:36 -> 01:39:38]  I got you and then
[01:39:38 -> 01:39:40]  found some.
[01:39:40 -> 01:39:42]  I'm not even worried about it.
[01:39:42 -> 01:39:44]  Alex probably played his brother the best.
[01:39:44 -> 01:39:46]  Like that's what the fourth brother would have done.
[01:39:46 -> 01:39:48]  Nothing.
[01:39:48 -> 01:39:50]  At least suspicious.
[01:39:50 -> 01:39:52]  Literally that's
[01:39:52 -> 01:39:54]  with the way I'm rolling, that's all I can do.
[01:39:54 -> 01:39:56]  The knight is
[01:39:56 -> 01:40:05]  the knight seems to be
[01:40:05 -> 01:40:07]  winding down.
[01:40:07 -> 01:40:09]  Yeah, it's like wrapping down like so
[01:40:09 -> 01:40:11]  um obviously you have time
[01:40:11 -> 01:40:13]  because like we're like
[01:40:13 -> 01:40:15]  all your scenes are not
[01:40:15 -> 01:40:17]  are kind of happening at the same time but also slightly
[01:40:17 -> 01:40:19]  disjointed in time like you know what I mean?
[01:40:19 -> 01:40:21]  Um so like we're
[01:40:21 -> 01:40:23]  rewinding a little bit so like
[01:40:23 -> 01:40:25]  after you got cock blocked like
[01:40:25 -> 01:40:30]  you know you
[01:40:30 -> 01:40:32]  still have some time but it's towards the end of the ball.
[01:40:32 -> 01:40:34]  Uh okay.
[01:40:34 -> 01:40:36]  I mean I guess I'll have to
[01:40:36 -> 01:40:38]  take another look around if there's any
[01:40:38 -> 01:40:40]  um interesting
[01:40:40 -> 01:40:42]  targets. Is Ophelia free again?
[01:40:42 -> 01:40:44]  If I can go chat with her. She went to
[01:40:44 -> 01:40:46]  towards her uncle.
[01:40:46 -> 01:40:48]  Don't know if I want to
[01:40:52 -> 01:40:54]  Um
[01:40:54 -> 01:40:59]  uh yeah
[01:40:59 -> 01:41:01]  I guess um
[01:41:01 -> 01:41:03]  can I look around the party again
[01:41:03 -> 01:41:05]  see if there's anything interesting
[01:41:05 -> 01:41:07]  happening?
[01:41:07 -> 01:41:09]  Uh yeah I mean
[01:41:09 -> 01:41:14]  for all perception
[01:41:14 -> 01:41:16]  yeah um so you see um
[01:41:16 -> 01:41:18]  yeah so you saw Ophelia
[01:41:18 -> 01:41:20]  like you were probably
[01:41:20 -> 01:41:22]  I'm assuming you were watching what was going on
[01:41:22 -> 01:41:24]  so yeah Alara's alone now
[01:41:24 -> 01:41:26]  um as Ophelia left
[01:41:26 -> 01:41:28]  uh Isidore is
[01:41:28 -> 01:41:30]  off with his own
[01:41:30 -> 01:41:32]  um
[01:41:32 -> 01:41:34]  with his like little own
[01:41:34 -> 01:41:36]  tray. I would assume still
[01:41:36 -> 01:41:38]  probably stealing food.
[01:41:38 -> 01:41:40]  Yeah. At this point. Um
[01:41:40 -> 01:41:42]  um
[01:41:42 -> 01:41:44]  kind of on his own
[01:41:44 -> 01:41:46]  uh you you see
[01:41:46 -> 01:41:48]  Nyx kind of just in the shadow
[01:41:48 -> 01:41:50]  um and you see at this point
[01:41:50 -> 01:41:52]  Witty would have still been there with on the arms
[01:41:52 -> 01:41:54]  of Jacinta.
[01:41:54 -> 01:41:56]  Okay
[01:41:56 -> 01:41:58]  And like that's reading
[01:41:58 -> 01:42:00]  very much like they're gonna
[01:42:00 -> 01:42:02]  do it. Like Witty's getting lucky
[01:42:02 -> 01:42:04]  tonight. Witty's not coming home to the
[01:42:04 -> 01:42:06]  house tonight.
[01:42:06 -> 01:42:08]  Witty has a big grin on his face.
[01:42:08 -> 01:42:10]  Yeah.
[01:42:10 -> 01:42:14]  So what do we have to
[01:42:14 -> 01:42:16]  what does he have to roll to know how the night went?
[01:42:16 -> 01:42:18]  Oh we'll
[01:42:18 -> 01:42:20]  get there don't worry.
[01:42:20 -> 01:42:22]  Performance check.
[01:42:24 -> 01:42:26]  Okay um
[01:42:26 -> 01:42:28]  I wanna do I wanna I wanna try another
[01:42:28 -> 01:42:30]  attack then instead of
[01:42:30 -> 01:42:32]  talking with people um
[01:42:32 -> 01:42:34]  I want to make my way over
[01:42:34 -> 01:42:36]  towards um
[01:42:36 -> 01:42:38]  Lady Ophelia and the
[01:42:38 -> 01:42:40]  Duke. I'm assuming that they're
[01:42:40 -> 01:42:42]  kind of like uh
[01:42:42 -> 01:42:44]  amongst the crowd.
[01:42:44 -> 01:42:46]  Not sequestered or anything away from
[01:42:46 -> 01:42:48]  Oh no they're like talking
[01:42:48 -> 01:42:50]  privately with uh
[01:42:50 -> 01:42:52]  when you approach you would
[01:42:52 -> 01:42:54]  notice Jonathan Rean
[01:42:54 -> 01:42:56]  Interesting. The Duke.
[01:42:56 -> 01:42:58]  Yeah. Ophelia and Proctor Edward.
[01:42:58 -> 01:43:00]  Oh ho
[01:43:00 -> 01:43:02]  ho
[01:43:02 -> 01:43:04]  Um can I
[01:43:04 -> 01:43:06]  roll anything and
[01:43:06 -> 01:43:08]  perhaps overhear any
[01:43:08 -> 01:43:10]  conversations that I'm not supposed to overhear?
[01:43:10 -> 01:43:12]  Delph is
[01:43:12 -> 01:43:14]  gonna be
[01:43:14 -> 01:43:16]  your first roll.
[01:43:16 -> 01:43:18]  What do you think I need to get on this
[01:43:18 -> 01:43:20]  stealth?
[01:43:20 -> 01:43:22]  Oh god.
[01:43:22 -> 01:43:24]  Um I would
[01:43:24 -> 01:43:26]  here's the thing.
[01:43:26 -> 01:43:28]  Yeah yeah yeah. It's gonna be a
[01:43:28 -> 01:43:30]  high DC. It's gonna be a high DC I
[01:43:30 -> 01:43:32]  understand that. It's going to be
[01:43:32 -> 01:43:34]  I'm not
[01:43:34 -> 01:43:36]  gonna do I'm also gonna double check
[01:43:36 -> 01:43:38]  something because I don't wanna do the whole
[01:43:38 -> 01:43:40]  thing where it's a blunt
[01:43:40 -> 01:43:42]  and you have plus 25 or something.
[01:43:42 -> 01:43:44]  Um
[01:43:44 -> 01:43:47]  I wanna make I
[01:43:47 -> 01:43:49]  I will say
[01:43:49 -> 01:43:54]  23.
[01:43:54 -> 01:43:56]  It's not impossible.
[01:43:56 -> 01:43:58]  It's not impossible.
[01:43:58 -> 01:44:00]  Hey you bit me. I'm gonna bite you.
[01:44:00 -> 01:44:02]  Okay.
[01:44:02 -> 01:44:04]  Um let's do this.
[01:44:04 -> 01:44:06]  I'm gonna try to I'm gonna try to position
[01:44:06 -> 01:44:08]  myself where I can overhear some
[01:44:08 -> 01:44:10]  um private
[01:44:10 -> 01:44:12]  conversations. Like you can
[01:44:12 -> 01:44:14]  like this is overhear and
[01:44:14 -> 01:44:16]  not get caught.
[01:44:16 -> 01:44:18]  Yeah yeah.
[01:44:18 -> 01:44:20]  If I can't get it
[01:44:20 -> 01:44:23]  done I don't wanna
[01:44:23 -> 01:44:25]  position myself in a way that would
[01:44:25 -> 01:44:27]  like be disastrous.
[01:44:27 -> 01:44:30]  Okay. And I will say
[01:44:34 -> 01:44:41]  Okay.
[01:44:41 -> 01:44:43]  I'm just moving through the crowd.
[01:44:43 -> 01:44:45]  Yeah.
[01:44:45 -> 01:44:47]  I'm just dancing through.
[01:44:47 -> 01:44:49]  Here's the thing. Um one thing you'll notice
[01:44:49 -> 01:44:51]  is Celia is massed still
[01:44:51 -> 01:44:53]  up like still talking like
[01:44:53 -> 01:44:55]  as the heir apparent
[01:44:55 -> 01:44:57]  22 year old young girl
[01:44:57 -> 01:44:59]  that she is still
[01:44:59 -> 01:45:01]  speaking like that um
[01:45:01 -> 01:45:03]  among them. Um and
[01:45:03 -> 01:45:05]  Proctor Edward go
[01:45:05 -> 01:45:07]  uh they're talking and basically
[01:45:07 -> 01:45:09]  kind of um
[01:45:09 -> 01:45:11]  she goes so uncle
[01:45:11 -> 01:45:13]  about about the
[01:45:13 -> 01:45:15]  soldiers that were um moved to the
[01:45:15 -> 01:45:17]  north um
[01:45:17 -> 01:45:19]  the it seems the
[01:45:19 -> 01:45:21]  uh um the
[01:45:21 -> 01:45:23]  resistance is stronger than expected
[01:45:23 -> 01:45:25]  and like
[01:45:25 -> 01:45:27]  and uh he goes
[01:45:27 -> 01:45:29]  uh yes it seems someone
[01:45:29 -> 01:45:31]  um
[01:45:31 -> 01:45:33]  someone escaped
[01:45:33 -> 01:45:35]  and was
[01:45:35 -> 01:45:37]  able to return and
[01:45:37 -> 01:45:39]  rally them. Though I thought
[01:45:39 -> 01:45:41]  Reeves I know
[01:45:41 -> 01:45:43]  I know you were gone but
[01:45:43 -> 01:45:45]  I thought you said the lighthouse
[01:45:45 -> 01:45:47]  um handled it.
[01:45:47 -> 01:45:53]  And Reeves goes
[01:45:53 -> 01:45:55]  hey
[01:45:55 -> 01:45:57]  you we had it
[01:45:57 -> 01:45:59]  um not too sure what happened
[01:45:59 -> 01:46:01]  there some people broke in
[01:46:01 -> 01:46:03]  and were able to
[01:46:03 -> 01:46:05]  free the subject
[01:46:05 -> 01:46:07]  and um looks
[01:46:07 -> 01:46:09]  like she went home and was ready
[01:46:09 -> 01:46:11]  to it uh
[01:46:11 -> 01:46:13]  we knew there was going it wasn't going to be this
[01:46:13 -> 01:46:15]  easy um it was
[01:46:15 -> 01:46:17]  I will say the lighthouse can do better
[01:46:17 -> 01:46:19]  for security but we didn't expect someone to break
[01:46:19 -> 01:46:21]  into it. Um
[01:46:21 -> 01:46:23]  you think those shadows would be a little bit more
[01:46:23 -> 01:46:25]  scared of the light
[01:46:25 -> 01:46:27]  huh but um
[01:46:27 -> 01:46:29]  I'm sure if we send some of our
[01:46:29 -> 01:46:31]  newest models up uh
[01:46:31 -> 01:46:33]  they'll make quick work of the
[01:46:33 -> 01:46:35]  Goliath and you see
[01:46:35 -> 01:46:37]  Ophelia um
[01:46:37 -> 01:46:39]  put on kind of like a
[01:46:39 -> 01:46:41]  like she like has
[01:46:41 -> 01:46:43]  a fan and uh
[01:46:43 -> 01:46:45]  she goes like kind of a shocked look
[01:46:45 -> 01:46:47]  on her face
[01:46:47 -> 01:46:49]  at the comment
[01:46:49 -> 01:46:51]  like a genuine kind of like a shocked look or kind of
[01:46:51 -> 01:46:53]  just
[01:46:53 -> 01:46:55]  she is she is Ophelia
[01:46:55 -> 01:46:58]  the air right now I will
[01:46:58 -> 01:47:00]  give you this for going
[01:47:00 -> 01:47:02]  back on the night 20 I'll be nice enough
[01:47:02 -> 01:47:04]  um
[01:47:04 -> 01:47:06]  this is not whether or
[01:47:06 -> 01:47:08]  not um
[01:47:08 -> 01:47:10]  you don't know whether or
[01:47:10 -> 01:47:12]  not she's this kind
[01:47:12 -> 01:47:14]  of mask is for her uncle
[01:47:14 -> 01:47:16]  too or
[01:47:16 -> 01:47:18]  she's still out in public and this
[01:47:18 -> 01:47:20]  is because it doesn't matter
[01:47:20 -> 01:47:22]  like she's still
[01:47:22 -> 01:47:24]  putting on a performance because there are still
[01:47:24 -> 01:47:26]  people watching and it doesn't matter
[01:47:26 -> 01:47:28]  if they can't hear no like
[01:47:28 -> 01:47:30]  watching out for eavesdroppers but they
[01:47:30 -> 01:47:32]  she still has to perform
[01:47:32 -> 01:47:34]  interesting okay I'm thinking of myself
[01:47:34 -> 01:47:36]  as Baradun I'm just like
[01:47:36 -> 01:47:38]  uh
[01:47:38 -> 01:47:40]  all my attraction to this woman
[01:47:40 -> 01:47:42]  as uh has been
[01:47:42 -> 01:47:44]  evaporated
[01:47:44 -> 01:47:46]  oh really
[01:47:46 -> 01:47:48]  like she's
[01:47:48 -> 01:47:50]  it sounds so
[01:47:50 -> 01:47:52]  blase about this whole thing I just I don't know
[01:47:52 -> 01:47:54]  just um
[01:47:54 -> 01:47:56]  I'm I'm sad
[01:47:56 -> 01:47:58]  that uh she seems
[01:47:58 -> 01:48:00]  to be
[01:48:00 -> 01:48:02]  aligning right along
[01:48:02 -> 01:48:04]  with these
[01:48:04 -> 01:48:06]  but yeah she
[01:48:06 -> 01:48:08]  expresses like shock
[01:48:08 -> 01:48:10]  and surprise about like kind of
[01:48:10 -> 01:48:12]  um Donathan's remarks
[01:48:12 -> 01:48:14]  um and then he kind of
[01:48:14 -> 01:48:16]  turns to it it's like
[01:48:16 -> 01:48:18]  Edward uh I know
[01:48:18 -> 01:48:20]  your um
[01:48:20 -> 01:48:22]  companion has been
[01:48:22 -> 01:48:24]  quite interested and had connections
[01:48:24 -> 01:48:26]  to this um
[01:48:26 -> 01:48:28]  I suppose you have that underhandle and he
[01:48:28 -> 01:48:30]  like don't worry about Alara
[01:48:30 -> 01:48:32]  she's more pious than
[01:48:32 -> 01:48:34]  she's more pious than the
[01:48:34 -> 01:48:36]  light itself she'll never
[01:48:36 -> 01:48:38]  as long as I tell her what to do she'll listen
[01:48:38 -> 01:48:40]  and trust me
[01:48:40 -> 01:48:44]  I have eyes on her
[01:48:44 -> 01:48:46]  can I record
[01:48:46 -> 01:48:48]  no
[01:48:48 -> 01:48:50]  don't worry I've been watching
[01:48:50 -> 01:48:52]  I've been watching her
[01:48:52 -> 01:48:55]  she will do
[01:48:55 -> 01:49:00]  as expected and
[01:49:00 -> 01:49:02]  he's like enough of these unpleasantries
[01:49:02 -> 01:49:04]  I do speaking of which
[01:49:04 -> 01:49:06]  do need to go find her
[01:49:06 -> 01:49:08]  um and uh he kind of walks away
[01:49:08 -> 01:49:10]  and Donathan goes yes I think

[01:52:25 -> 01:52:29]  I spoke to Alara
[01:52:31 -> 01:52:33]  I thought I thought um
[01:52:33 -> 01:52:35]  I thought he spoke to Donathan Reeves
[01:52:35 -> 01:52:38]  too well
[01:52:38 -> 01:52:40]  when you all got introduced at the beginning
[01:52:40 -> 01:52:42]  oh okay okay who
[01:52:42 -> 01:52:44]  was the one that Donathan Reeves was was talking
[01:52:44 -> 01:52:46]  to Nick
[01:52:46 -> 01:52:48]  yeah that was another guy
[01:52:48 -> 01:52:50]  okay okay okay okay um
[01:52:50 -> 01:52:52]  that was number four
[01:52:52 -> 01:52:54]  oh god damn it
[01:52:54 -> 01:52:56]  you're five Baradun's three
[01:52:56 -> 01:52:58]  Alex is four okay Isidor
[01:52:58 -> 01:53:00]  uh just make sure you don't
[01:53:00 -> 01:53:02]  drink too much one second guys I'm listening
[01:53:02 -> 01:53:04]  I'll be right back okay
[01:53:04 -> 01:53:09]  homophobia it's fine
[01:53:09 -> 01:53:11]  I've only had a glasses
[01:53:11 -> 01:53:13]  okay I haven't
[01:53:13 -> 01:53:15]  I haven't had anything to drink yet
[01:53:15 -> 01:53:17]  tonight so I also
[01:53:17 -> 01:53:19]  grab a grab a drink
[01:53:19 -> 01:53:21]  um
[01:53:21 -> 01:53:23]  from nearby yeah
[01:53:23 -> 01:53:25]  and
[01:53:25 -> 01:53:27]  I'll say at this point um
[01:53:27 -> 01:53:29]  uh
[01:53:29 -> 01:53:31]  you would have noticed Witty is
[01:53:31 -> 01:53:33]  leaving on the arms of Josintha
[01:53:33 -> 01:53:35]  and uh the
[01:53:35 -> 01:53:37]  party's kind of winding down
[01:53:37 -> 01:53:43]  okay um
[01:53:43 -> 01:53:45]  I I I go
[01:53:45 -> 01:53:47]  I think this will just be in
[01:53:47 -> 01:53:49]  character I I actually
[01:53:49 -> 01:53:51]  I'm thinking to myself that Isidor would be the
[01:53:51 -> 01:53:53]  one that's the easiest prey
[01:53:53 -> 01:53:55]  so I went to him first
[01:53:55 -> 01:53:57]  and so now I'm just gonna go
[01:53:57 -> 01:53:59]  uh I'm gonna try to catch up
[01:53:59 -> 01:54:01]  with Lord Witty to see
[01:54:01 -> 01:54:03]  if he needs any help
[01:54:03 -> 01:54:05]  the original Lord Witty
[01:54:05 -> 01:54:07]  um
[01:54:07 -> 01:54:09]  ho ho because we
[01:54:09 -> 01:54:11]  already resolved this

[01:54:24 -> 01:54:26]  uh between a one and a five
[01:54:26 -> 01:54:28]  you're able to just catch him
[01:54:28 -> 01:54:30]  before he leaves
[01:54:30 -> 01:54:32]  otherwise no dice

[01:55:02 -> 01:55:04]  people like leaving and that
[01:55:04 -> 01:55:06]  like I would say there's a few people in front of you
[01:55:06 -> 01:55:08]  when you got there and that's kind of what
[01:55:08 -> 01:55:10]  caused you not to be able to
[01:55:10 -> 01:55:12]  yeah um like people are like
[01:55:12 -> 01:55:14]  leaving and they're just kind of waiting
[01:55:14 -> 01:55:16]  in line for the valet service
[01:55:16 -> 01:55:18]  okay um okay
[01:55:18 -> 01:55:20]  I just can't do anything with him um
[01:55:20 -> 01:55:22]  can I do I spot
[01:55:22 -> 01:55:24]  Nyx
[01:55:24 -> 01:55:28]  um
[01:55:28 -> 01:55:30]  hold your horses for a second
[01:55:30 -> 01:55:32]  let's go to Nyx
[01:55:32 -> 01:55:34]  um and I'll say
[01:55:34 -> 01:55:36]  this so to open that
[01:55:36 -> 01:55:38]  little scene as you kind of come back
[01:55:38 -> 01:55:40]  in to go to Nyx
[01:55:40 -> 01:55:42]  you see and you when you finally
[01:55:42 -> 01:55:44]  see him you see Donathan Reeves
[01:55:44 -> 01:55:46]  beside Nyx
[01:55:46 -> 01:55:48]  Nyx we're gonna turn to you
[01:55:48 -> 01:55:50]  go a little bit moment back
[01:55:50 -> 01:55:52]  um again from
[01:55:52 -> 01:55:54]  uh just beside
[01:55:54 -> 01:55:56]  you uh a man can you
[01:55:56 -> 01:55:58]  hear us now I hear you I was on
[01:55:58 -> 01:56:00]  double mute um back so
[01:56:00 -> 01:56:02]  we're back in time a little bit
[01:56:02 -> 01:56:04]  right slightly just a moment
[01:56:04 -> 01:56:06]  um and so I guess I
[01:56:06 -> 01:56:08]  assume you're leaning against something and another
[01:56:08 -> 01:56:10]  man leans against and goes
[01:56:10 -> 01:56:12]  and it's Donathan Reeves and goes
[01:56:12 -> 01:56:14]  well four
[01:56:14 -> 01:56:16]  you're still here you didn't leave
[01:56:16 -> 01:56:18]  a man
[01:56:18 -> 01:56:20]  of my word
[01:56:20 -> 01:56:22]  well um there's a
[01:56:22 -> 01:56:24]  little um
[01:56:24 -> 01:56:26]  after party
[01:56:26 -> 01:56:30]  would you want to attend
[01:56:30 -> 01:56:32]  and I Nyx like
[01:56:32 -> 01:56:34]  is really
[01:56:34 -> 01:56:36]  pushing the whole like
[01:56:36 -> 01:56:38]  reluctant
[01:56:38 -> 01:56:40]  I don't like to do
[01:56:40 -> 01:56:42]  this but I told my brother
[01:56:42 -> 01:56:44]  I'd do this kind of
[01:56:44 -> 01:56:46]  thing and he looks around and goes
[01:56:46 -> 01:56:48]  and looks at Donathan and
[01:56:48 -> 01:56:50]  goes
[01:56:50 -> 01:56:52]  kind of a little a little sigh
[01:56:52 -> 01:56:54]  and he goes
[01:56:54 -> 01:56:56]  yeah I think you'd do
[01:56:56 -> 01:56:58]  me some good
[01:56:58 -> 01:57:00]  I think it would do all of us
[01:57:00 -> 01:57:02]  some good um
[01:57:02 -> 01:57:04]  uh
[01:57:04 -> 01:57:06]  before we
[01:57:06 -> 01:57:08]  resolve this is
[01:57:08 -> 01:57:10]  Geridan going to
[01:57:10 -> 01:57:12]  interfere as you kind of
[01:57:12 -> 01:57:14]  see Donathan
[01:57:14 -> 01:57:16]  as you would if you
[01:57:16 -> 01:57:18]  continue to as you're kind of getting a little bit
[01:57:18 -> 01:57:20]  closer you see Donathan leave the way and
[01:57:20 -> 01:57:22]  Nyx following him
[01:57:22 -> 01:57:24]  are you going to interrupt that
[01:57:24 -> 01:57:26]  I know because I am not like
[01:57:26 -> 01:57:28]  Alara
[01:57:30 -> 01:57:32]  I was just
[01:57:32 -> 01:57:34]  concerned these are grown
[01:57:34 -> 01:57:36]  men that can handle
[01:57:36 -> 01:57:38]  themselves
[01:57:38 -> 01:57:40]  Nyx
[01:57:40 -> 01:57:42]  internally is panicking
[01:57:44 -> 01:57:46]  he's like save me save me
[01:57:46 -> 01:57:48]  no no no
[01:57:48 -> 01:57:50]  yeah so
[01:57:50 -> 01:57:52]  do I notice any
[01:57:52 -> 01:57:54]  look on Nyx's face
[01:57:54 -> 01:57:56]  showing his
[01:57:56 -> 01:57:58]  no
[01:57:58 -> 01:58:00]  no
[01:58:00 -> 01:58:02]  um
[01:58:02 -> 01:58:04]  this has to be contested
[01:58:04 -> 01:58:06]  um
[01:58:06 -> 01:58:08]  buh buh
[01:58:08 -> 01:58:10]  buh buh I would either say from
[01:58:10 -> 01:58:12]  Nyx part you would either have
[01:58:12 -> 01:58:14]  to go
[01:58:14 -> 01:58:16]  like persuasion
[01:58:16 -> 01:58:18]  performance versus an
[01:58:18 -> 01:58:20]  insight oh and this is with
[01:58:20 -> 01:58:22]  against Baradun yeah
[01:58:22 -> 01:58:24]  against Baradun you're rolling against each other
[01:58:24 -> 01:58:26]  persuasion
[01:58:26 -> 01:58:28]  rolling twice I've got oh
[01:58:28 -> 01:58:30]  this is bad oh boy
[01:58:30 -> 01:58:32]  oh boy all right so let me I'm gonna
[01:58:32 -> 01:58:34]  roll let's do
[01:58:34 -> 01:58:36]  uh
[01:58:36 -> 01:58:38]  battling uh
[01:58:38 -> 01:58:40]  because
[01:58:40 -> 01:58:42]  Baradun asks if he sees
[01:58:42 -> 01:58:44]  Nyx's internal turmoil
[01:58:44 -> 01:58:46]  he does not
[01:58:46 -> 01:58:48]  he does
[01:58:48 -> 01:58:50]  not I don't know why I'm happy
[01:58:50 -> 01:58:52]  that's not a good thing
[01:58:52 -> 01:58:54]  go get him bro no no no no no
[01:58:54 -> 01:58:56]  yeah so
[01:58:56 -> 01:58:58]  Baradun we'll leave you
[01:58:58 -> 01:59:00]  stranded for a moment while we resolve a little
[01:59:00 -> 01:59:02]  Nyx's scene Nyx

[01:59:04 -> 01:59:06]  uh Jonathan uh

[01:59:14 -> 01:59:16]  kind of undoing a few buttons as he walks
[01:59:16 -> 01:59:18]  and he's just not talking
[01:59:18 -> 01:59:20]  about much he's like oh it's been

[02:01:51 -> 02:01:53]  nothing in this
[02:01:53 -> 02:01:55]  under the light that would bring
[02:01:55 -> 02:01:57]  the fourth son into
[02:01:57 -> 02:02:02]  Bastion City
[02:02:02 -> 02:02:04]  I

[02:02:39 -> 02:02:41]  that's I wanted to do the
[02:02:41 -> 02:02:43]  sex red herring because I would never like
[02:02:43 -> 02:02:45]  do like a
[02:02:45 -> 02:02:47]  full on sex scene like that
[02:02:47 -> 02:02:49]  like you should have known
[02:02:49 -> 02:02:51]  as soon as he was like whatever like
[02:02:51 -> 02:02:53]  this was a trap
[02:02:53 -> 02:02:55]  I don't know maybe you got inspired by heated rivalry and you're like
[02:02:55 -> 02:02:57]  no fade to black
[02:02:57 -> 02:02:59]  no fade to black no
[02:02:59 -> 02:03:03]  I would say
[02:03:03 -> 02:03:05]  that
[02:03:05 -> 02:03:07]  Nyx
[02:03:07 -> 02:03:09]  clocks both of them
[02:03:09 -> 02:03:11]  and obviously is like
[02:03:11 -> 02:03:13]  okay
[02:03:13 -> 02:03:15]  like
[02:03:15 -> 02:03:17]  they fuck you
[02:03:17 -> 02:03:19]  but sure
[02:03:19 -> 02:03:21]  yeah they did they did
[02:03:21 -> 02:03:23]  so it's like I'm in trouble
[02:03:23 -> 02:03:25]  but the gig isn't up
[02:03:25 -> 02:03:27]  yet
[02:03:27 -> 02:03:29]  well
[02:03:29 -> 02:03:31]  well
[02:03:31 -> 02:03:33]  so I just say nothing I just I just look
[02:03:33 -> 02:03:35]  and I and I just I just look at both of them
[02:03:35 -> 02:03:37]  and I
[02:03:37 -> 02:03:39]  I kind of lean against
[02:03:39 -> 02:03:41]  I do the whole lean again
[02:03:41 -> 02:03:43]  against whatever wall is closest to me
[02:03:43 -> 02:03:45]  nonchalantly
[02:03:45 -> 02:03:47]  and I just look at them
[02:03:47 -> 02:03:49]  a silent type
[02:03:49 -> 02:03:51]  you wouldn't be the first silent type
[02:03:51 -> 02:03:53]  that I made scream
[02:03:53 -> 02:03:55]  but
[02:03:55 -> 02:03:57]  let's see poor
[02:03:57 -> 02:03:59]  poor poor witty all he wants
[02:03:59 -> 02:04:01]  is the love of his family
[02:04:01 -> 02:04:03]  and
[02:04:03 -> 02:04:05]  let's see
[02:04:05 -> 02:04:07]  you were you made friends with him
[02:04:07 -> 02:04:09]  he was probably the dupe wasn't
[02:04:09 -> 02:04:11]  he
[02:04:11 -> 02:04:13]  and if witty
[02:04:13 -> 02:04:15]  if you're not real
[02:04:15 -> 02:04:17]  that would probably make
[02:04:17 -> 02:04:19]  the other two not real
[02:04:29 -> 02:04:31]  let's see
[02:04:31 -> 02:04:33]  if you're not real
[02:04:33 -> 02:04:35]  and so
[02:04:35 -> 02:04:37]  that means there's two other
[02:04:37 -> 02:04:39]  conspirators
[02:04:39 -> 02:04:41]  obviously
[02:04:41 -> 02:04:43]  one of you could not
[02:04:43 -> 02:04:45]  wasn't the greatest of a brother
[02:04:45 -> 02:04:47]  and the other
[02:04:47 -> 02:04:49]  dear Ophelia
[02:04:49 -> 02:04:51]  good luck with that
[02:04:51 -> 02:04:53]  to him
[02:04:53 -> 02:04:55]  so
[02:04:55 -> 02:04:57]  what to do
[02:04:57 -> 02:04:59]  now
[02:04:59 -> 02:05:04]  so at this point
[02:05:04 -> 02:05:06]  I'm still quiet
[02:05:06 -> 02:05:08]  I'm quiet because it's
[02:05:08 -> 02:05:10]  at this point
[02:05:10 -> 02:05:12]  anything I say
[02:05:12 -> 02:05:14]  will be
[02:05:14 -> 02:05:16]  will be used against me
[02:05:16 -> 02:05:22]  hmm
[02:05:22 -> 02:05:24]  are you sure you don't want to say anything
[02:05:24 -> 02:05:31]  I do like the strong
[02:05:31 -> 02:05:33]  silent type
[02:05:33 -> 02:05:41]  ask only under here
[02:05:41 -> 02:05:43]  the pause is not nix
[02:05:43 -> 02:05:45]  the pause is Alex being like
[02:05:45 -> 02:05:47]  what the fuck do I do
[02:05:47 -> 02:05:49]  maybe
[02:05:49 -> 02:05:51]  pretend that you're
[02:05:51 -> 02:05:53]  another one of the witty brothers
[02:05:53 -> 02:05:55]  no
[02:05:55 -> 02:05:57]  I'm Whitaker the seventh
[02:05:57 -> 02:05:59]  I'm the
[02:05:59 -> 02:06:01]  illegitimate child that
[02:06:01 -> 02:06:03]  came out of nowhere
[02:06:03 -> 02:06:05]  I'm 4.5
[02:06:05 -> 02:06:07]  yeah
[02:06:07 -> 02:06:09]  no the teachings of
[02:06:09 -> 02:06:11]  eulogia say honesty is
[02:06:11 -> 02:06:13]  what brings you closest to the light
[02:06:13 -> 02:06:15]  oh
[02:06:15 -> 02:06:17]  you also have been a woodsman so you've been
[02:06:17 -> 02:06:19]  you've been like working out since the last time
[02:06:19 -> 02:06:21]  they saw you you're pretty
[02:06:21 -> 02:06:23]  you could be pretty jacked from that
[02:06:23 -> 02:06:25]  yeah I mean it's
[02:06:25 -> 02:06:27]  I still the thing is I still don't
[02:06:27 -> 02:06:29]  know
[02:06:29 -> 02:06:31]  whether they actually know
[02:06:31 -> 02:06:33]  the truth they obviously don't know who
[02:06:33 -> 02:06:35]  I am actually but
[02:06:35 -> 02:06:37]  they just suspect that I'm not
[02:06:37 -> 02:06:39]  and I
[02:06:39 -> 02:06:41]  okay so I said and I look I look at them
[02:06:41 -> 02:06:43]  and I go what
[02:06:43 -> 02:06:45]  makes you think that I'm not
[02:06:45 -> 02:06:47]  his brother like I
[02:06:47 -> 02:06:49]  said you would never
[02:06:49 -> 02:06:51]  everything witty
[02:06:51 -> 02:06:53]  wants is the love of his family so his
[02:06:53 -> 02:06:55]  family showing up
[02:06:55 -> 02:06:57]  one and two would be too obvious
[02:06:57 -> 02:06:59]  um his parents
[02:06:59 -> 02:07:01]  basically sent him here to be out of sight
[02:07:01 -> 02:07:03]  out of mind um that was a
[02:07:03 -> 02:07:05]  well-known thing
[02:07:05 -> 02:07:07]  among
[02:07:07 -> 02:07:09]  the Vesalian art
[02:07:09 -> 02:07:11]  um wow I was about to
[02:07:11 -> 02:07:13]  say artifacts aristocracy
[02:07:13 -> 02:07:15]  um so all of you
[02:07:15 -> 02:07:17]  showing up you all
[02:07:17 -> 02:07:19]  up in Bois
[02:07:19 -> 02:07:21]  all up north who
[02:07:21 -> 02:07:23]  generally there's
[02:07:23 -> 02:07:25]  a reason why while there's not
[02:07:25 -> 02:07:27]  much opportunities for third fourth
[02:07:27 -> 02:07:29]  fifth sixth whatever child
[02:07:29 -> 02:07:31]  really your parents went out like
[02:07:31 -> 02:07:33]  rabbit his parents went out like rabbits
[02:07:33 -> 02:07:35]  you think they have more love for the kids
[02:07:35 -> 02:07:37]  um
[02:07:37 -> 02:07:39]  there would be no reason
[02:07:39 -> 02:07:41]  there's no financial
[02:07:41 -> 02:07:43]  gain or incentive for you to come here
[02:07:43 -> 02:07:45]  um you
[02:07:45 -> 02:07:47]  the fourth son went
[02:07:47 -> 02:07:49]  there got away from the
[02:07:49 -> 02:07:51]  I mean you can't get much further than Bois d'un
[02:07:51 -> 02:07:53]  from your family by going there
[02:07:53 -> 02:07:56]  the chances are
[02:07:56 -> 02:07:58]  very very high you aren't
[02:07:58 -> 02:08:00]  that and witty
[02:08:00 -> 02:08:02]  sweet kids
[02:08:02 -> 02:08:04]  sweet kid indeed
[02:08:04 -> 02:08:06]  he is a sweet kid
[02:08:06 -> 02:08:08]  he is
[02:08:08 -> 02:08:10]  and uh
[02:08:10 -> 02:08:12]  like um Donathan's like in his forties
[02:08:12 -> 02:08:14]  so like he's
[02:08:14 -> 02:08:16]  yeah yeah yeah yeah
[02:08:16 -> 02:08:18]  older like he would have saw
[02:08:18 -> 02:08:20]  witty probably more as a kid
[02:08:20 -> 02:08:22]  I would say right I'm getting the ages right
[02:08:22 -> 02:08:24]  Matt yeah like
[02:08:24 -> 02:08:26]  yeah so he would always seen him
[02:08:26 -> 02:08:28]  a bit like a kid
[02:08:28 -> 02:08:30]  um
[02:08:30 -> 02:08:32]  so Nix looks at both of them
[02:08:32 -> 02:08:34]  and just exhales
[02:08:34 -> 02:08:36]  sighs and just
[02:08:36 -> 02:08:38]  grabs like just like
[02:08:38 -> 02:08:40]  kind of like holds the bridge of
[02:08:40 -> 02:08:42]  his nose and is like
[02:08:42 -> 02:08:44]  still leaned up against the wall
[02:08:44 -> 02:08:46]  and is just kind of like
[02:08:46 -> 02:08:48]  just shrugs
[02:08:48 -> 02:08:50]  and goes ugh
[02:08:50 -> 02:08:52]  I thought something like
[02:08:52 -> 02:08:54]  this would happen
[02:08:54 -> 02:08:56]  I am his
[02:08:56 -> 02:08:58]  brother
[02:08:58 -> 02:09:00]  and you're right
[02:09:00 -> 02:09:02]  there is
[02:09:02 -> 02:09:04]  I thought there wouldn't be a reason for me to come back
[02:09:04 -> 02:09:06]  but something came up
[02:09:06 -> 02:09:08]  and I need information
[02:09:08 -> 02:09:10]  and so
[02:09:10 -> 02:09:12]  here I am
[02:09:12 -> 02:09:14]  and I was hoping to just
[02:09:14 -> 02:09:16]  be here
[02:09:16 -> 02:09:18]  and not make a big
[02:09:18 -> 02:09:20]  stink about it
[02:09:20 -> 02:09:22]  pardon my language
[02:09:22 -> 02:09:24]  it has been a while
[02:09:24 -> 02:09:26]  but uh
[02:09:26 -> 02:09:28]  you've drawn me out
[02:09:28 -> 02:09:30]  oh
[02:09:30 -> 02:09:32]  and what about the other two
[02:09:32 -> 02:09:34]  interesting if true
[02:09:34 -> 02:09:36]  but
[02:09:36 -> 02:09:38]  so you are just using your brother for
[02:09:38 -> 02:09:40]  something else and the other two
[02:09:40 -> 02:09:42]  siblings just happen to be
[02:09:42 -> 02:09:44]  here in this backwater
[02:09:44 -> 02:09:46]  I mean
[02:09:46 -> 02:09:48]  we both
[02:09:48 -> 02:09:50]  this backwater imperial province
[02:09:50 -> 02:09:52]  just happen to be there
[02:09:52 -> 02:09:54]  I'm going well
[02:09:54 -> 02:09:56]  actually I think you might believe me on
[02:09:56 -> 02:09:58]  this one I have no idea why
[02:09:58 -> 02:10:00]  they want to be here but he did
[02:10:00 -> 02:10:02]  a damn good job pulling us together
[02:10:02 -> 02:10:04]  for the first time in his life
[02:10:08 -> 02:10:10]  and I look I look at them
[02:10:10 -> 02:10:12]  I look at them and I
[02:10:12 -> 02:10:14]  stop I stop
[02:10:14 -> 02:10:16]  because I like that
[02:10:16 -> 02:10:18]  it kind of like it's like when you say
[02:10:18 -> 02:10:20]  too much in a family setting
[02:10:20 -> 02:10:22]  oh yeah
[02:10:22 -> 02:10:24]  outside the family
[02:10:24 -> 02:10:26]  I said too much and it's like
[02:10:26 -> 02:10:28]  and then I kind of I want the
[02:10:28 -> 02:10:30]  really obviously
[02:10:30 -> 02:10:32]  snap my mouth shut
[02:10:32 -> 02:10:34]  and just look at them and go
[02:10:34 -> 02:10:36]  sigh again and be like
[02:10:38 -> 02:10:42]  I said too much
[02:10:42 -> 02:10:44]  okay
[02:10:44 -> 02:10:49]  so you will do
[02:10:49 -> 02:10:52]  mhm
[02:10:52 -> 02:10:54]  are you
[02:10:56 -> 02:10:58]  I would say this is a
[02:10:58 -> 02:11:00]  deception
[02:11:00 -> 02:11:02]  deception yep
[02:11:02 -> 02:11:04]  I forgot deception
[02:11:04 -> 02:11:06]  this is a deception
[02:11:06 -> 02:11:08]  and it'll be against an insight
[02:11:08 -> 02:11:10]  okay oh jeez okay here we go
[02:11:10 -> 02:11:17]  eight
[02:11:17 -> 02:11:19]  I would need to roll a nat one
[02:11:19 -> 02:11:21]  let's see how do
[02:11:21 -> 02:11:23]  I roll from here again game log
[02:11:23 -> 02:11:25]  it doesn't let me okay
[02:11:25 -> 02:11:27]  I'm rolling my actual dice
[02:11:27 -> 02:11:29]  if I get a nat one you'll win
[02:11:29 -> 02:11:31]  you win
[02:11:31 -> 02:11:33]  if not you lose
[02:11:33 -> 02:11:35]  this is 13
[02:11:35 -> 02:11:37]  mark can confirm if you want
[02:11:37 -> 02:11:39]  no I believe you I want you to confirm mark
[02:11:39 -> 02:11:41]  I don't trust you you can move the dice
[02:11:41 -> 02:11:43]  let me see this
[02:11:43 -> 02:11:45]  let me see this number
[02:11:45 -> 02:11:47]  that is a one and a three I do confirm
[02:11:47 -> 02:11:49]  for a second you're like that is a one
[02:11:49 -> 02:11:51]  a one
[02:11:51 -> 02:11:53]  and a three
[02:11:53 -> 02:11:55]  god damn it
[02:11:55 -> 02:11:57]  so you see
[02:11:57 -> 02:11:59]  he looks at you and goes
[02:11:59 -> 02:12:01]  well then
[02:12:01 -> 02:12:03]  what was the piece of
[02:12:03 -> 02:12:05]  he just acts he goes
[02:12:05 -> 02:12:07]  what was the piece of information
[02:12:07 -> 02:12:09]  you were needing maybe I can provide
[02:12:09 -> 02:12:11]  something with a key
[02:12:11 -> 02:12:15]  we take her the fourth
[02:12:15 -> 02:12:17]  oh and I
[02:12:17 -> 02:12:19]  look and I think at this point
[02:12:19 -> 02:12:21]  nix who is being really
[02:12:21 -> 02:12:23]  kind of
[02:12:23 -> 02:12:25]  nonchalant and then we had that little
[02:12:25 -> 02:12:27]  that slit
[02:12:27 -> 02:12:29]  that fake slit
[02:12:29 -> 02:12:31]  this time he looks
[02:12:31 -> 02:12:33]  at them and
[02:12:33 -> 02:12:35]  he gets off the wall
[02:12:35 -> 02:12:37]  and
[02:12:37 -> 02:12:39]  he says
[02:12:39 -> 02:12:41]  I've been gone
[02:12:41 -> 02:12:43]  for quite a while
[02:12:43 -> 02:12:45]  and
[02:12:45 -> 02:12:47]  in I'll spare you the
[02:12:47 -> 02:12:49]  details
[02:12:49 -> 02:12:51]  and he kind of waves his hand I'll spare you the
[02:12:51 -> 02:12:53]  details but I've seen
[02:12:53 -> 02:12:55]  some things in my
[02:12:55 -> 02:12:57]  in my travels out
[02:12:57 -> 02:12:59]  oh hang on

[02:13:25 -> 02:13:27]  so

[02:13:37 -> 02:13:39]  goes
[02:13:39 -> 02:13:41]  sister alara I think it's time
[02:13:41 -> 02:13:43]  to return the seminary as things are winding down
[02:13:43 -> 02:13:45]  um how did you
[02:13:45 -> 02:13:47]  enjoy your time
[02:13:47 -> 02:13:49]  she says oh it was quite
[02:13:49 -> 02:13:51]  lovely um
[02:13:51 -> 02:13:53]  it
[02:13:53 -> 02:13:55]  I don't know that I remember
[02:13:55 -> 02:13:57]  most of the names of the people you introduced
[02:13:57 -> 02:13:59]  me to but I did make notes
[02:13:59 -> 02:14:01]  of it so I can study them later
[02:14:01 -> 02:14:04]  hmm
[02:14:04 -> 02:14:06]  and then she says oh and
[02:14:06 -> 02:14:08]  it was so nice to see
[02:14:08 -> 02:14:10]  yloja so
[02:14:10 -> 02:14:12]  prominent in the ducal
[02:14:12 -> 02:14:14]  family
[02:14:14 -> 02:14:16]  oh yes
[02:14:16 -> 02:14:18]  Ophelia has been devout since a young
[02:14:18 -> 02:14:22]  girl
[02:14:22 -> 02:14:24]  yes I could notice she
[02:14:24 -> 02:14:26]  I was very
[02:14:26 -> 02:14:29]  humbled by her wisdom
[02:14:29 -> 02:14:31]  for someone
[02:14:31 -> 02:14:33]  my age
[02:14:33 -> 02:14:35]  yes
[02:14:35 -> 02:14:37]  yes she's had a very strict
[02:14:37 -> 02:14:39]  upbringing you know being
[02:14:39 -> 02:14:41]  the heir
[02:14:41 -> 02:14:43]  to the grand duchy
[02:14:43 -> 02:14:45]  so she has been well versed
[02:14:45 -> 02:14:47]  but yes yes a lovely
[02:14:47 -> 02:14:49]  young lady and I'm glad you had some time to speak
[02:14:49 -> 02:14:51]  further on the matter of yloja
[02:14:51 -> 02:14:53]  um
[02:14:53 -> 02:14:55]  and yeah he's kind of as you're
[02:14:55 -> 02:14:57]  talking kind of going towards the exit in line
[02:14:57 -> 02:14:59]  kind of to take the carriage
[02:14:59 -> 02:15:01]  and says
[02:15:01 -> 02:15:03]  I hope you
[02:15:03 -> 02:15:09]  I did see
[02:15:09 -> 02:15:11]  that you were able to talk to Donathan
[02:15:11 -> 02:15:13]  and the duke were you able to
[02:15:13 -> 02:15:15]  um
[02:15:15 -> 02:15:17]  find out anything more about
[02:15:17 -> 02:15:19]  what happened
[02:15:19 -> 02:15:21]  um well Donathan just returned
[02:15:21 -> 02:15:23]  um a lot of
[02:15:23 -> 02:15:25]  he did put an inquiry at the
[02:15:25 -> 02:15:27]  dustbreaker lighthouse but
[02:15:27 -> 02:15:29]  you may have noticed there was some
[02:15:29 -> 02:15:31]  ruckus around there too right
[02:15:31 -> 02:15:33]  so things are a little
[02:15:33 -> 02:15:35]  disarray he has a lot of fires he's
[02:15:35 -> 02:15:37]  trying to put out at the same time
[02:15:37 -> 02:15:39]  but um
[02:15:39 -> 02:15:41]  but he did assure me that he is
[02:15:41 -> 02:15:43]  they are doing an investigation
[02:15:43 -> 02:15:45]  onto exactly what happened
[02:15:45 -> 02:15:47]  wait
[02:15:47 -> 02:15:49]  would a random person
[02:15:49 -> 02:15:51]  at the seminary know
[02:15:51 -> 02:15:53]  that something happened at the lighthouse
[02:15:53 -> 02:15:55]  I'm trying to think
[02:15:55 -> 02:15:57]  um
[02:15:57 -> 02:15:59]  it would have been like enough of
[02:15:59 -> 02:16:01]  like a whisper talk like
[02:16:01 -> 02:16:03]  with like the changes of guards and
[02:16:03 -> 02:16:05]  everything so it would have to be like
[02:16:05 -> 02:16:07]  it's not like they're announcing it but
[02:16:07 -> 02:16:09]  like something
[02:16:09 -> 02:16:13]  weird happened
[02:16:13 -> 02:16:15]  that's great to hear
[02:16:15 -> 02:16:17]  I am so happy that
[02:16:17 -> 02:16:19]  um
[02:16:19 -> 02:16:21]  people in
[02:16:21 -> 02:16:23]  the city are
[02:16:23 -> 02:16:25]  this um interested
[02:16:25 -> 02:16:27]  in finding the truth a lot of
[02:16:27 -> 02:16:29]  people back in my hometown
[02:16:29 -> 02:16:31]  kept saying that everyone here
[02:16:31 -> 02:16:33]  was scheming and looking out for
[02:16:33 -> 02:16:35]  themselves and it's
[02:16:35 -> 02:16:37]  just so great
[02:16:37 -> 02:16:39]  to know that that's not the case
[02:16:39 -> 02:16:41]  well yes like any place there
[02:16:41 -> 02:16:43]  are no saints there are not
[02:16:43 -> 02:16:45]  everyone is a saint and
[02:16:45 -> 02:16:47]  some will give into their more
[02:16:47 -> 02:16:49]  shadowed nature but
[02:16:49 -> 02:16:51]  we are not as scary as
[02:16:51 -> 02:16:53]  it is to make believe
[02:16:53 -> 02:16:55]  often I think there's this worry
[02:16:55 -> 02:16:57]  of something being lost when you leave
[02:16:57 -> 02:16:59]  your town but as
[02:16:59 -> 02:17:01]  you can see it's not quite the case
[02:17:01 -> 02:17:03]  often you gain many new friends
[02:17:03 -> 02:17:05]  and people along the way
[02:17:05 -> 02:17:07]  just goes oh yes
[02:17:07 -> 02:17:09]  I do hope that is the case
[02:17:09 -> 02:17:11]  and I am
[02:17:11 -> 02:17:13]  so glad that you are the proctor
[02:17:13 -> 02:17:15]  at the seminary
[02:17:15 -> 02:17:17]  I just cannot imagine what would have happened
[02:17:17 -> 02:17:19]  had
[02:17:19 -> 02:17:21]  had I come to
[02:17:21 -> 02:17:24]  the place that I was warned
[02:17:24 -> 02:17:26]  a place more like the one I was warned about
[02:17:26 -> 02:17:28]  oh
[02:17:28 -> 02:17:30]  well
[02:17:30 -> 02:17:32]  I do appreciate that though
[02:17:32 -> 02:17:34]  I'm sure any other brother or sister
[02:17:34 -> 02:17:36]  would have ran the seminary
[02:17:36 -> 02:17:38]  just as well as I do
[02:17:38 -> 02:17:40]  I am after all
[02:17:40 -> 02:17:42]  as much as you just a humble eulogian
[02:17:42 -> 02:17:47]  she
[02:17:47 -> 02:17:49]  just like
[02:17:49 -> 02:17:53]  she just goes oh that's strange
[02:17:53 -> 02:17:55]  um
[02:17:55 -> 02:17:57]  that's not
[02:17:57 -> 02:17:59]  I hear that a lot today
[02:17:59 -> 02:18:01]  perhaps I will have to
[02:18:01 -> 02:18:03]  pray on it
[02:18:03 -> 02:18:05]  sister
[02:18:05 -> 02:18:07]  Lara you should not
[02:18:07 -> 02:18:09]  you should not measure yourself
[02:18:09 -> 02:18:11]  by any other after all
[02:18:11 -> 02:18:13]  under the light we are all
[02:18:13 -> 02:18:15]  the same
[02:18:15 -> 02:18:17]  she's like oh yes
[02:18:17 -> 02:18:19]  I do keep saying that but
[02:18:19 -> 02:18:21]  seeing how far away some
[02:18:21 -> 02:18:23]  people seem
[02:18:23 -> 02:18:25]  it's just hard to believe
[02:18:25 -> 02:18:27]  at times
[02:18:27 -> 02:18:29]  yes sometimes
[02:18:29 -> 02:18:31]  it is hard to
[02:18:31 -> 02:18:33]  know people's inner thoughts and feelings
[02:18:33 -> 02:18:35]  but that is just part of living in this world
[02:18:35 -> 02:18:37]  whether it's the light
[02:18:37 -> 02:18:39]  or not
[02:18:39 -> 02:18:41]  it is just part of interacting
[02:18:41 -> 02:18:43]  and growing
[02:18:45 -> 02:18:47]  it's like yes
[02:18:47 -> 02:18:49]  I certainly have a lot of growing to do
[02:18:49 -> 02:18:53]  if I ever want to catch up
[02:18:53 -> 02:18:55]  it's not a race my child
[02:18:55 -> 02:18:57]  it's not a race
[02:18:57 -> 02:18:59]  we will all grow in our time
[02:18:59 -> 02:19:01]  with enough light and water
[02:19:01 -> 02:19:03]  to plant we will grow
[02:19:03 -> 02:19:07]  and flourish
[02:19:07 -> 02:19:09]  I know it may not be a race but
[02:19:09 -> 02:19:11]  our time on
[02:19:11 -> 02:19:13]  earth is still limited
[02:19:13 -> 02:19:15]  and there is so much
[02:19:15 -> 02:19:17]  I wish to be able to know
[02:19:17 -> 02:19:19]  and understand
[02:19:19 -> 02:19:21]  and that is why
[02:19:21 -> 02:19:23]  you are such an
[02:19:23 -> 02:19:25]  app student
[02:19:25 -> 02:19:27]  and at that point kind of guides you into
[02:19:27 -> 02:19:29]  the carriage as it arrives and such
[02:19:29 -> 02:19:31]  um
[02:19:31 -> 02:19:33]  now let's go back
[02:19:33 -> 02:19:35]  into this
[02:19:35 -> 02:19:37]  so yeah
[02:19:37 -> 02:19:39]  Donathan Reeves goes
[02:19:39 -> 02:19:41]  so what piece of information were you looking for
[02:19:41 -> 02:19:43]  oh there we go
[02:19:43 -> 02:19:45]  ok you hear me
[02:19:45 -> 02:19:47]  ok cool
[02:19:47 -> 02:19:49]  so um
[02:19:49 -> 02:19:51]  how do I want to say this
[02:19:51 -> 02:19:53]  so I get very
[02:19:53 -> 02:19:55]  I was very kind of nonchalant
[02:19:55 -> 02:19:57]  gave that little outburst
[02:19:57 -> 02:19:59]  but now I get very stony faced
[02:19:59 -> 02:20:01]  and
[02:20:01 -> 02:20:03]  I look at them
[02:20:03 -> 02:20:05]  putting off the air of absolute
[02:20:05 -> 02:20:07]  seriousness
[02:20:07 -> 02:20:09]  and
[02:20:09 -> 02:20:11]  um I would say
[02:20:11 -> 02:20:13]  in my travels
[02:20:13 -> 02:20:15]  I've heard
[02:20:15 -> 02:20:17]  whispers
[02:20:17 -> 02:20:19]  of
[02:20:19 -> 02:20:21]  a situation that I'm
[02:20:21 -> 02:20:23]  I don't have enough
[02:20:23 -> 02:20:25]  information on but I'm trying to
[02:20:25 -> 02:20:27]  figure it out
[02:20:27 -> 02:20:29]  and
[02:20:29 -> 02:20:31]  so it may seem
[02:20:31 -> 02:20:33]  you may actually know
[02:20:33 -> 02:20:35]  some of this
[02:20:35 -> 02:20:37]  but I'm a little hesitant
[02:20:37 -> 02:20:40]  to ask you
[02:20:40 -> 02:20:42]  well I would be
[02:20:42 -> 02:20:44]  a little less hesitant one call from
[02:20:44 -> 02:20:46]  either me or the Duke
[02:20:46 -> 02:20:48]  here and you will be
[02:20:48 -> 02:20:50]  in the deepest reaches of prisons
[02:20:50 -> 02:20:52]  and will never see the light of day again
[02:20:52 -> 02:20:54]  so it behooves you to speak
[02:20:54 -> 02:20:56]  Witted Haker
[02:20:56 -> 02:20:58]  the fourth
[02:20:58 -> 02:21:00]  do
[02:21:00 -> 02:21:02]  do you know anything
[02:21:02 -> 02:21:04]  about
[02:21:04 -> 02:21:06]  the
[02:21:06 -> 02:21:08]  use
[02:21:08 -> 02:21:15]  of
[02:21:15 -> 02:21:17]  I don't want to say this
[02:21:17 -> 02:21:19]  of shadowed
[02:21:19 -> 02:21:21]  to
[02:21:21 -> 02:21:23]  power
[02:21:23 -> 02:21:25]  our entire city
[02:21:25 -> 02:21:32]  our city is not
[02:21:32 -> 02:21:34]  powered entirely
[02:21:34 -> 02:21:36]  by
[02:21:36 -> 02:21:38]  powered by shadows what do you mean
[02:21:38 -> 02:21:40]  powered by shadows
[02:21:40 -> 02:21:42]  I also
[02:21:42 -> 02:21:44]  I am telling you everything I know
[02:21:44 -> 02:21:46]  but these are the whispers that I
[02:21:46 -> 02:21:48]  have heard and I'm
[02:21:48 -> 02:21:50]  trying to uncover more
[02:21:50 -> 02:21:52]  about this all the way up
[02:21:52 -> 02:21:54]  north in Baudin those are the whispers
[02:21:54 -> 02:21:56]  you heard I wasn't just
[02:21:56 -> 02:21:58]  in Baudin
[02:21:58 -> 02:22:00]  oh I guess
[02:22:00 -> 02:22:02]  you do travel around
[02:22:02 -> 02:22:04]  I like to stay under the radar
[02:22:04 -> 02:22:06]  I'm sure you
[02:22:06 -> 02:22:08]  do um
[02:22:08 -> 02:22:10]  I as
[02:22:10 -> 02:22:12]  you hopefully
[02:22:12 -> 02:22:14]  are not foolish enough to be
[02:22:14 -> 02:22:16]  ignorant in I am
[02:22:16 -> 02:22:18]  the director of relations in the
[02:22:18 -> 02:22:20]  Dustbreaker Lighthouse I've heard
[02:22:20 -> 02:22:22]  nothing as so barbarous as
[02:22:22 -> 02:22:24]  that there are light crystals
[02:22:24 -> 02:22:26]  as you have seen here
[02:22:26 -> 02:22:28]  and throughout
[02:22:28 -> 02:22:30]  Bastion City and
[02:22:30 -> 02:22:32]  Pharos in the capital and that
[02:22:32 -> 02:22:34]  but they're mined
[02:22:34 -> 02:22:36]  these are mined and refined
[02:22:36 -> 02:22:38]  through the lighthouse's
[02:22:38 -> 02:22:40]  various factories and processes
[02:22:40 -> 02:22:42]  there's not shadowed
[02:22:42 -> 02:22:44]  and barbarous
[02:22:44 -> 02:22:46]  nothing within the light would be so
[02:22:46 -> 02:22:48]  barbaric as that
[02:22:48 -> 02:22:50]  bizarre rumors then
[02:22:50 -> 02:22:52]  sometimes like he's shaking
[02:22:52 -> 02:22:54]  I'm shaking my head like Nick
[02:22:54 -> 02:22:56]  like Nick says is he's like really
[02:22:56 -> 02:22:58]  like
[02:22:58 -> 02:23:00]  so what they're
[02:23:00 -> 02:23:02]  seeing it kind of is
[02:23:02 -> 02:23:04]  just he's going like
[02:23:04 -> 02:23:06]  oh okay then what are these crazy
[02:23:06 -> 02:23:08]  rumors like oh if you don't
[02:23:08 -> 02:23:10]  know then what is it but internally
[02:23:10 -> 02:23:12]  internally what you're
[02:23:12 -> 02:23:14]  what is actually thinking
[02:23:14 -> 02:23:16]  is all right so
[02:23:16 -> 02:23:18]  this guy either he actually
[02:23:18 -> 02:23:20]  doesn't know
[02:23:20 -> 02:23:22]  which is wild
[02:23:22 -> 02:23:24]  or
[02:23:24 -> 02:23:26]  he's completely lying to me and
[02:23:26 -> 02:23:28]  I kind of
[02:23:28 -> 02:23:30]  I was hoping for too much with
[02:23:30 -> 02:23:32]  this so but what you're
[02:23:32 -> 02:23:34]  so it's the same it's the same
[02:23:34 -> 02:23:36]  external reaction but for
[02:23:36 -> 02:23:38]  different reasons yeah and
[02:23:38 -> 02:23:40]  he goes
[02:23:40 -> 02:23:42]  to you and goes like I'm like thinking
[02:23:42 -> 02:23:44]  like I'm pensive very pensive
[02:23:44 -> 02:23:46]  right now it's really not a hard
[02:23:46 -> 02:23:48]  puzzle to solve people do not like
[02:23:48 -> 02:23:50]  change like crystals
[02:23:50 -> 02:23:52]  are change and so often
[02:23:52 -> 02:23:54]  people will just
[02:23:54 -> 02:23:56]  see anything new
[02:23:56 -> 02:23:58]  as threatening and in their
[02:23:58 -> 02:24:00]  ignorance spread rumors
[02:24:00 -> 02:24:02]  that have no base
[02:24:02 -> 02:24:04]  the shadowed
[02:24:04 -> 02:24:08]  as maybe
[02:24:08 -> 02:24:10]  not the most egotistic thing I'm about to say
[02:24:10 -> 02:24:12]  but the shadows are a convenient boogeyman
[02:24:12 -> 02:24:14]  for many things
[02:24:14 -> 02:24:16]  and so
[02:24:16 -> 02:24:18]  people saying this new
[02:24:18 -> 02:24:20]  technology and the shadows
[02:24:20 -> 02:24:22]  are running the cities
[02:24:22 -> 02:24:24]  is fearmongering
[02:24:24 -> 02:24:28]  and ignorance
[02:24:28 -> 02:24:30]  but I'm sure you know best
[02:24:30 -> 02:24:32]  since you're of
[02:24:32 -> 02:24:36]  course
[02:24:36 -> 02:24:38]  is that all
[02:24:38 -> 02:24:43]  would take her the forest well that
[02:24:43 -> 02:24:45]  was a lot I didn't I
[02:24:45 -> 02:24:47]  apologize for bothering you with
[02:24:47 -> 02:24:49]  such a
[02:24:49 -> 02:24:51]  such a question I
[02:24:51 -> 02:24:53]  was hoping to do this
[02:24:53 -> 02:24:55]  on my own and not disrupt you
[02:24:55 -> 02:24:57]  well then if you
[02:24:57 -> 02:24:59]  and your brother
[02:24:59 -> 02:25:01]  you can go return with your brothers
[02:25:01 -> 02:25:03]  back home I do
[02:25:03 -> 02:25:05]  have a duke to take care of
[02:25:05 -> 02:25:07]  and he gives a bow
[02:25:07 -> 02:25:09]  he kind of steps
[02:25:09 -> 02:25:11]  past you and
[02:25:11 -> 02:25:13]  don't slam the door on the way out
[02:25:13 -> 02:25:15]  I do
[02:25:15 -> 02:25:17]  a bow and I
[02:25:17 -> 02:25:21]  walk out yeah there
[02:25:21 -> 02:25:23]  yeah
[02:25:23 -> 02:25:25]  and there's an
[02:25:25 -> 02:25:27]  old guard waiting for you at the
[02:25:27 -> 02:25:29]  door to escort you back
[02:25:29 -> 02:25:31]  okay
[02:25:31 -> 02:25:33]  well they didn't kill me yet
[02:25:33 -> 02:25:35]  like
[02:25:35 -> 02:25:37]  cue the snipers
[02:25:37 -> 02:25:39]  cue the snipers
[02:25:39 -> 02:25:41]  so
[02:25:41 -> 02:25:43]  check your GPS trackers
[02:25:43 -> 02:25:45]  so yeah
[02:25:45 -> 02:25:47]  I cannot beat Whitaker the fourth anymore
[02:25:47 -> 02:25:49]  ever again
[02:25:49 -> 02:25:51]  at the nukal palace who we have
[02:25:51 -> 02:25:53]  left is Din
[02:25:53 -> 02:25:55]  Nick
[02:25:55 -> 02:26:00]  and Ysidor
[02:26:00 -> 02:26:02]  yeah so I
[02:26:02 -> 02:26:04]  do I I okay
[02:26:04 -> 02:26:06]  you're escorted back to like
[02:26:06 -> 02:26:08]  the ballroom

[02:26:10 -> 02:26:12]  um
[02:26:12 -> 02:26:14]  I will say you can find Ysidor
[02:26:14 -> 02:26:16]  because I don't know where Din went
[02:26:16 -> 02:26:18]  in the meantime and I
[02:26:18 -> 02:26:22]  think Avi's at a range
[02:26:22 -> 02:26:28]  or maybe he's like on the
[02:26:28 -> 02:26:30]  toilet or something
[02:26:30 -> 02:26:32]  he just hears me say
[02:26:32 -> 02:26:34]  his name um
[02:26:34 -> 02:26:36]  I'm sorry I'm just muted I'm just
[02:26:36 -> 02:26:38]  kind of running around oh no it's
[02:26:38 -> 02:26:40]  fair it's just um so
[02:26:40 -> 02:26:42]  when you see Nix go
[02:26:42 -> 02:26:44]  away what do you do because um
[02:26:44 -> 02:26:46]  in the meantime

[02:28:42 -> 02:28:44]  left yeah so we get the last
[02:28:44 -> 02:28:46]  one and then
[02:28:46 -> 02:28:48]  we head out
[02:28:48 -> 02:28:50]  yeah so you're in your carriage back
[02:28:50 -> 02:28:52]  okay so I'll talk
[02:28:52 -> 02:28:54]  I I just look at everyone and I go okay
[02:28:54 -> 02:28:56]  so I want to say
[02:28:56 -> 02:28:58]  I met
[02:28:58 -> 02:29:00]  with Oleander and
[02:29:00 -> 02:29:03]  Donovan in person
[02:29:03 -> 02:29:05]  in their office
[02:29:05 -> 02:29:07]  and
[02:29:07 -> 02:29:09]  they immediately
[02:29:09 -> 02:29:11]  suspected me
[02:29:11 -> 02:29:13]  um
[02:29:13 -> 02:29:15]  thinking that I was not
[02:29:15 -> 02:29:17]  the oh Whitaker the fourth
[02:29:17 -> 02:29:19]  and
[02:29:19 -> 02:29:21]  I did my best
[02:29:21 -> 02:29:23]  and used the
[02:29:23 -> 02:29:25]  opportunity to ask
[02:29:25 -> 02:29:27]  them directly
[02:29:27 -> 02:29:29]  if they knew anything
[02:29:29 -> 02:29:31]  that was going on
[02:29:31 -> 02:29:33]  um
[02:29:33 -> 02:29:35]  with the taking shadows
[02:29:35 -> 02:29:37]  and without going into too much detail
[02:29:37 -> 02:29:39]  shadowed being used
[02:29:39 -> 02:29:41]  to power the light crystals
[02:29:41 -> 02:29:43]  if they knew anything
[02:29:43 -> 02:29:45]  so I was like why not
[02:29:45 -> 02:29:47]  I'm here they're here they'll probably
[02:29:47 -> 02:29:49]  lie to me but let me at least try
[02:29:49 -> 02:29:51]  something maybe I'll get some glimmer
[02:29:51 -> 02:29:53]  of of truth
[02:29:53 -> 02:29:55]  what was Oleander trying to do
[02:29:55 -> 02:29:57]  oh wait what happened
[02:29:57 -> 02:29:59]  I was like
[02:29:59 -> 02:30:01]  I'm like what are you trying to do jump up the cart
[02:30:01 -> 02:30:03]  yeah wait
[02:30:03 -> 02:30:07]  yeah so going back
[02:30:07 -> 02:30:09]  to Nick's
[02:30:09 -> 02:30:11]  yeah no and so I say now
[02:30:11 -> 02:30:13]  the
[02:30:13 -> 02:30:15]  the bad news
[02:30:15 -> 02:30:17]  is they said
[02:30:17 -> 02:30:19]  no nothing
[02:30:19 -> 02:30:21]  right they are nothing's going
[02:30:21 -> 02:30:23]  on with that that they're aware
[02:30:23 -> 02:30:25]  of um
[02:30:25 -> 02:30:27]  it could be a bold faced lie
[02:30:27 -> 02:30:29]  it could be
[02:30:29 -> 02:30:31]  something they're actually not aware of
[02:30:31 -> 02:30:33]  Oleander didn't say shit
[02:30:33 -> 02:30:35]  um
[02:30:35 -> 02:30:37]  I mean we know I know
[02:30:37 -> 02:30:39]  but I it's like yeah I mean yes
[02:30:39 -> 02:30:41]  he is lying we don't know about the duke
[02:30:41 -> 02:30:43]  we don't know about the duke yeah we know that
[02:30:43 -> 02:30:45]  it's right that's right we do know that Donovan
[02:30:45 -> 02:30:47]  does know about this
[02:30:47 -> 02:30:49]  so he's lying but I just
[02:30:49 -> 02:30:51]  wanted is that me
[02:30:51 -> 02:30:53]  did I pop on no
[02:30:53 -> 02:30:55]  Mark did an update okay
[02:30:55 -> 02:30:57]  no and
[02:30:57 -> 02:30:59]  that's right
[02:30:59 -> 02:31:01]  that's right okay so I just wanted to be clear so yeah
[02:31:01 -> 02:31:03]  Donovan does obviously knows okay
[02:31:03 -> 02:31:05]  Donovan lied said nothing's happening
[02:31:05 -> 02:31:07]  but I was hoping to get something
[02:31:07 -> 02:31:09]  from Oleander Oleander
[02:31:09 -> 02:31:11]  and he just stayed mum
[02:31:11 -> 02:31:13]  um so
[02:31:13 -> 02:31:15]  all in all a failure on that didn't get any
[02:31:15 -> 02:31:17]  information and
[02:31:17 -> 02:31:19]  I don't think it's a good
[02:31:19 -> 02:31:21]  idea
[02:31:21 -> 02:31:23]  um for us to be disguised
[02:31:23 -> 02:31:25]  as the Whitaker's anymore
[02:31:25 -> 02:31:27]  because
[02:31:27 -> 02:31:29]  both Oleander and
[02:31:29 -> 02:31:31]  Donovan Hughes are suspicious
[02:31:31 -> 02:31:33]  of all of us Donovan Hughes
[02:31:33 -> 02:31:35]  Donovan Hughes sorry
[02:31:35 -> 02:31:37]  Donovan Reeves Donovan Hughes
[02:31:37 -> 02:31:39]  um
[02:31:39 -> 02:31:41]  Whitty I look at you
[02:31:41 -> 02:31:43]  Whitty's not with you
[02:31:43 -> 02:31:45]  that's right he's gone that's right
[02:31:45 -> 02:31:47]  Whitty is
[02:31:47 -> 02:31:49]  getting his black
[02:31:49 -> 02:31:51]  uh his back blown out
[02:31:51 -> 02:31:53]  I thought he just sent that like
[02:31:53 -> 02:31:55]  yes that's right I was gonna say you cut
[02:31:55 -> 02:31:57]  to me I have like a bridle in my
[02:31:57 -> 02:31:59]  mouth
[02:31:59 -> 02:32:01]  I'm sideways
[02:32:01 -> 02:32:03]  yeah
[02:32:03 -> 02:32:05]  and I I
[02:32:05 -> 02:32:07]  okay so then I look at yeah
[02:32:07 -> 02:32:09]  you do that and then I just go I know
[02:32:09 -> 02:32:11]  so Whitty isn't here but
[02:32:11 -> 02:32:13]  you know they know
[02:32:13 -> 02:32:15]  they're pretty certain that Whitty is
[02:32:15 -> 02:32:17]  Whitty um but for the rest
[02:32:17 -> 02:32:19]  of us they
[02:32:19 -> 02:32:21]  suspect that we are not
[02:32:21 -> 02:32:23]  who we say we are
[02:32:23 -> 02:32:25]  um
[02:32:25 -> 02:32:27]  yeah
[02:32:27 -> 02:32:29]  but they let me go
[02:32:29 -> 02:32:31]  no
[02:32:31 -> 02:32:33]  I don't think we've ever burned through so many
[02:32:33 -> 02:32:35]  identities in like
[02:32:35 -> 02:32:37]  like we've gone through like seven
[02:32:37 -> 02:32:39]  each of us
[02:32:39 -> 02:32:41]  look you have two brothers left
[02:32:41 -> 02:32:43]  Whitty has
[02:32:43 -> 02:32:45]  two brothers left to fake
[02:32:45 -> 02:32:47]  maybe a seventh
[02:32:47 -> 02:32:49]  that's the new secret seventh brother
[02:32:49 -> 02:32:51]  the secret secret sibling
[02:32:51 -> 02:32:53]  actually while Whitty was gone
[02:32:53 -> 02:32:55]  he had another one
[02:32:55 -> 02:32:57]  the many covered
[02:32:59 -> 02:33:01]  no so so
[02:33:01 -> 02:33:03]  so Nix just kind of looks at everyone and
[02:33:03 -> 02:33:05]  just goes honestly at this point kind
[02:33:05 -> 02:33:07]  of at a loss for what to do
[02:33:07 -> 02:33:09]  um
[02:33:09 -> 02:33:11]  but we do need to be careful
[02:33:11 -> 02:33:20]  yeah and then he sighs
[02:33:20 -> 02:33:22]  hey guys I'm so sorry I'm just
[02:33:22 -> 02:33:24]  doing my dishes that's why I'm not
[02:33:24 -> 02:33:26]  talking but um
[02:33:26 -> 02:33:28]  um is
[02:33:28 -> 02:33:30]  Alara here right now with me no
[02:33:30 -> 02:33:32]  it's just it's Ysidor
[02:33:32 -> 02:33:34]  it's Ysidor
[02:33:34 -> 02:33:36]  um Nix and
[02:33:36 -> 02:33:38]  Din it's just the three of
[02:33:38 -> 02:33:40]  you uh by the way they're
[02:33:40 -> 02:33:42]  gonna bring you back to Whitty's because that's
[02:33:42 -> 02:33:44]  it was Whitty who got the
[02:33:44 -> 02:33:46]  that makes sense
[02:33:46 -> 02:33:48]  yeah um so
[02:33:48 -> 02:33:50]  so we'll have to tell them
[02:33:50 -> 02:33:52]  I listened to the story really intently
[02:33:52 -> 02:33:54]  and then I'm going like okay
[02:33:54 -> 02:33:56]  so just to be clear like you didn't actually score
[02:33:56 -> 02:33:58]  at all
[02:34:00 -> 02:34:02]  that I don't swing
[02:34:02 -> 02:34:04]  that way
[02:34:04 -> 02:34:06]  okay
[02:34:06 -> 02:34:08]  all right good all is right
[02:34:08 -> 02:34:10]  in the world
[02:34:10 -> 02:34:12]  all is right in the world
[02:34:12 -> 02:34:14]  the quickest like
[02:34:14 -> 02:34:16]  180
[02:34:16 -> 02:34:18]  yeah that's true
[02:34:18 -> 02:34:20]  okay um
[02:34:20 -> 02:34:22]  ask me what I found out
[02:34:22 -> 02:34:24]  like
[02:34:24 -> 02:34:26]  what did you find out
[02:34:26 -> 02:34:28]  okay I was super slick and
[02:34:28 -> 02:34:30]  um I managed to overhear
[02:34:30 -> 02:34:32]  a conversation between
[02:34:32 -> 02:34:34]  like the four most
[02:34:34 -> 02:34:36]  powerful people in our in our city
[02:34:38 -> 02:34:40]  um a lot of things
[02:34:40 -> 02:34:42]  um
[02:34:42 -> 02:34:44]  um they are aware of
[02:34:44 -> 02:34:46]  um
[02:34:46 -> 02:34:48]  oh so talking about the mining town
[02:34:48 -> 02:34:50]  um
[02:34:50 -> 02:34:52]  they are aware that
[02:34:52 -> 02:34:54]  uh there it seems like
[02:34:54 -> 02:34:56]  Mary Marie
[02:34:56 -> 02:34:58]  is it Mary Mary
[02:34:58 -> 02:35:00]  Mary Mary has instigated
[02:35:00 -> 02:35:02]  some sort of uh
[02:35:02 -> 02:35:04]  or fomented some sort of rebellion
[02:35:04 -> 02:35:06]  in there that's slowing down their
[02:35:06 -> 02:35:08]  progress um
[02:35:08 -> 02:35:10]  in the Goliath town
[02:35:10 -> 02:35:12]  um
[02:35:12 -> 02:35:14]  that sounds like Mary
[02:35:14 -> 02:35:16]  like super happy
[02:35:16 -> 02:35:18]  and she seems to be quite a thorn
[02:35:18 -> 02:35:20]  in their sides right now
[02:35:20 -> 02:35:22]  um
[02:35:22 -> 02:35:24]  let me try to think about what else
[02:35:24 -> 02:35:26]  um uh everyone
[02:35:26 -> 02:35:28]  seems to be
[02:35:28 -> 02:35:30]  uh seems to be aware
[02:35:30 -> 02:35:32]  of what is happening so I'm not sure what they
[02:35:32 -> 02:35:34]  might have not told you
[02:35:34 -> 02:35:36]  uh Nyx but
[02:35:36 -> 02:35:38]  um they're all
[02:35:38 -> 02:35:40]  uh from from what I could gather
[02:35:40 -> 02:35:42]  uh and I
[02:35:42 -> 02:35:44]  overheard the duke I overheard
[02:35:44 -> 02:35:46]  the duke's
[02:35:46 -> 02:35:48]  niece and Donathan
[02:35:48 -> 02:35:50]  Reeves and um
[02:35:50 -> 02:35:52]  Proctor Edward they all seem to be
[02:35:52 -> 02:35:54]  somewhat aware uh they're all like
[02:35:54 -> 02:35:56]  super super racist
[02:35:56 -> 02:35:58]  towards Shadow um
[02:35:58 -> 02:36:00]  that's
[02:36:00 -> 02:36:02]  that's what
[02:36:02 -> 02:36:04]  wait right I mean they all seem like
[02:36:04 -> 02:36:06]  very very um
[02:36:06 -> 02:36:08]  anti-shadow which
[02:36:08 -> 02:36:10]  I guess we kind of already knew some of that already
[02:36:10 -> 02:36:12]  well you knew it that tracks yeah
[02:36:12 -> 02:36:14]  um but
[02:36:14 -> 02:36:16]  I I really don't think that
[02:36:16 -> 02:36:18]  uh Edward
[02:36:18 -> 02:36:21]  uh is as
[02:36:21 -> 02:36:23]  uh as good
[02:36:23 -> 02:36:25]  as as uh as Alara makes
[02:36:25 -> 02:36:27]  him seem to be um
[02:36:27 -> 02:36:29]  that much is certain
[02:36:29 -> 02:36:31]  I mean I think we all kind of knew that but I think she needs to have
[02:36:31 -> 02:36:33]  like a she needs to
[02:36:33 -> 02:36:35]  come to Jesus yeah
[02:36:35 -> 02:36:37]  um I don't know I like
[02:36:37 -> 02:36:39]  what do I do guys because
[02:36:39 -> 02:36:41]  um recording
[02:36:41 -> 02:36:43]  I don't think they've been invented yet in this
[02:36:43 -> 02:36:45]  world so I don't know if we have
[02:36:45 -> 02:36:47]  that capability um
[02:36:47 -> 02:36:49]  but this guy
[02:36:49 -> 02:36:51]  this guy's bad news like he
[02:36:51 -> 02:36:53]  they're all bad news he basically
[02:36:53 -> 02:36:55]  uh you know
[02:36:55 -> 02:36:57]  said that he has Alara wrapped around his
[02:36:57 -> 02:37:02]  finger but you know Alara
[02:37:02 -> 02:37:04]  like she's not gonna she's not gonna wanna
[02:37:04 -> 02:37:06]  do it
[02:37:06 -> 02:37:08]  not gonna believe me is he raw
[02:37:08 -> 02:37:10]  yeah
[02:37:10 -> 02:37:12]  raw well
[02:37:12 -> 02:37:14]  uh yeah so
[02:37:14 -> 02:37:16]  as you all kind of make
[02:37:16 -> 02:37:18]  your way back it is
[02:37:18 -> 02:37:20]  night time we'll
[02:37:20 -> 02:37:22]  we'll flash into
[02:37:22 -> 02:37:24]  the morning um
[02:37:24 -> 02:37:26]  Witty you wake up
[02:37:26 -> 02:37:28]  alone in bed
[02:37:30 -> 02:37:32]  since you
[02:37:32 -> 02:37:34]  described some of this I I will say
[02:37:34 -> 02:37:36]  a bit bruised a bit sore
[02:37:36 -> 02:37:38]  still kind of tired
[02:37:38 -> 02:37:40]  um
[02:37:40 -> 02:37:43]  and uh I
[02:37:43 -> 02:37:45]  will say uh once you decide to
[02:37:45 -> 02:37:47]  leave the bedroom you will see just
[02:37:47 -> 02:37:49]  Samantha all done up drinking
[02:37:49 -> 02:37:51]  um her morning tea
[02:37:51 -> 02:37:53]  um
[02:37:53 -> 02:37:55]  no care in the world
[02:37:55 -> 02:37:57]  and she's like
[02:37:57 -> 02:37:59]  oh uh there are uh
[02:37:59 -> 02:38:01]  some extra breakfast for you young
[02:38:01 -> 02:38:03]  sir um and then you
[02:38:03 -> 02:38:05]  um

[02:38:11 -> 02:38:13]  so
[02:38:13 -> 02:38:15]  uh
[02:38:15 -> 02:38:17]  just letting you eat
[02:38:17 -> 02:38:19]  yeah yeah yeah I was gonna say am I in like
[02:38:19 -> 02:38:21]  uh I imagine myself
[02:38:21 -> 02:38:23]  in a purple bathrobe
[02:38:23 -> 02:38:25]  who's imagining that dude
[02:38:25 -> 02:38:27]  velour
[02:38:27 -> 02:38:29]  purple velour
[02:38:29 -> 02:38:31]  there's like a place set
[02:38:31 -> 02:38:33]  like for you
[02:38:33 -> 02:38:35]  um it's not
[02:38:35 -> 02:38:37]  near her seat but there's a place set
[02:38:37 -> 02:38:39]  for you to like eat but like
[02:38:39 -> 02:38:41]  very much like
[02:38:41 -> 02:38:43]  the vibe she's giving is like hey that was
[02:38:43 -> 02:38:45]  fun but like this is not serious
[02:38:45 -> 02:38:47]  yeah absolutely so I'm gonna
[02:38:47 -> 02:38:49]  I'm gonna like kinda like uh
[02:38:49 -> 02:38:51]  waddle slowly over
[02:38:51 -> 02:38:53]  to the table in in
[02:38:53 -> 02:38:55]  soreness and decline sitting
[02:38:55 -> 02:38:57]  down um
[02:38:57 -> 02:38:59]  and just kinda just kinda
[02:38:59 -> 02:39:01]  you know grab something off
[02:39:01 -> 02:39:03]  the off it to eat and um
[02:39:03 -> 02:39:05]  you know at and uh
[02:39:05 -> 02:39:07]  literally I I enjoyed myself
[02:39:07 -> 02:39:09]  too that was that was great
[02:39:09 -> 02:39:14]  um and I'm trying
[02:39:14 -> 02:39:16]  to remember back to what she said to me before
[02:39:16 -> 02:39:18]  uh oh um
[02:39:18 -> 02:39:20]  there's
[02:39:20 -> 02:39:22]  there's uh quite the
[02:39:22 -> 02:39:24]  quite the
[02:39:24 -> 02:39:26]  uh uh range of
[02:39:26 -> 02:39:28]  people at that ball last night
[02:39:28 -> 02:39:30]  I know uh you shared
[02:39:30 -> 02:39:32]  some juicy gossip with me
[02:39:32 -> 02:39:35]  um
[02:39:35 -> 02:39:37]  did you did you see anything uh
[02:39:37 -> 02:39:39]  interesting at the at the party that
[02:39:39 -> 02:39:41]  you'd wanna you know let me know well
[02:39:41 -> 02:39:43]  I mean it looks like your brother tried
[02:39:43 -> 02:39:45]  to um
[02:39:45 -> 02:39:47]  flirt
[02:39:47 -> 02:39:49]  flirt with the heiress but
[02:39:49 -> 02:39:51]  um it would seem that
[02:39:51 -> 02:39:53]  that was to no avail as
[02:39:53 -> 02:39:55]  the guest of Proctor
[02:39:55 -> 02:39:57]  Edward then sought her companionship
[02:39:57 -> 02:39:59]  so I I
[02:39:59 -> 02:40:01]  I think maybe you will have some gossip
[02:40:01 -> 02:40:03]  for me do not be
[02:40:03 -> 02:40:05]  shy whatever you find out to
[02:40:05 -> 02:40:07]  send me a letter at least
[02:40:07 -> 02:40:09]  uh oh I definitely will my eyes go
[02:40:09 -> 02:40:11]  kinda wide because I've completely
[02:40:11 -> 02:40:13]  forgotten that I was with these
[02:40:13 -> 02:40:15]  other people that I had just
[02:40:15 -> 02:40:17]  met yesterday and that they I totally
[02:40:17 -> 02:40:19]  forgot and then I realized like
[02:40:19 -> 02:40:21]  uh they might be at my house
[02:40:21 -> 02:40:23]  at this moment
[02:40:23 -> 02:40:25]  cause uh and and I and I
[02:40:25 -> 02:40:27]  realize that Din has my has a key
[02:40:27 -> 02:40:29]  to my place so um
[02:40:29 -> 02:40:31]  I suddenly
[02:40:31 -> 02:40:33]  get a little I I I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna
[02:40:33 -> 02:40:35]  make a quicker exit than than I
[02:40:35 -> 02:40:37]  planned to right there and I'm gonna
[02:40:37 -> 02:40:39]  I'm gonna excuse myself and and tell her
[02:40:39 -> 02:40:41]  it was a pleasure and I'll and I'll uh
[02:40:41 -> 02:40:43]  I'll write
[02:40:43 -> 02:40:45]  um are you still in the velour bag
[02:40:45 -> 02:40:47]  or are you changing clothes
[02:40:47 -> 02:40:49]  uh no I'm gonna I'm I'm walking out in the
[02:40:49 -> 02:40:51]  in the bathrobe
[02:40:51 -> 02:40:53]  um he doesn't even like
[02:40:53 -> 02:40:55]  like whatever um
[02:40:55 -> 02:40:57]  I I feel like Witty's gonna
[02:40:57 -> 02:40:59]  have a hard time finding his way home
[02:40:59 -> 02:41:01]  he's not the best in direction
[02:41:01 -> 02:41:03]  yeah and I have I have nothing on me
[02:41:03 -> 02:41:05]  besides my purple silk bathrobe
[02:41:05 -> 02:41:07]  and probably purple silk
[02:41:07 -> 02:41:09]  silk slippers also
[02:41:09 -> 02:41:11]  oh my god
[02:41:11 -> 02:41:15]  um
[02:41:15 -> 02:41:17]  I think um so what I
[02:41:17 -> 02:41:19]  will say is
[02:41:19 -> 02:41:21]  um
[02:41:21 -> 02:41:23]  as you're walking the street um
[02:41:23 -> 02:41:25]  I know some one of the part things
[02:41:25 -> 02:41:27]  of Nyx is like you do
[02:41:27 -> 02:41:29]  have like your connections
[02:41:29 -> 02:41:31]  underground connections um
[02:41:31 -> 02:41:33]  and you know
[02:41:33 -> 02:41:35]  like there is like a drop spot
[02:41:35 -> 02:41:37]  nearby and you go out Nyx
[02:41:37 -> 02:41:39]  so just look at and like this is not
[02:41:39 -> 02:41:41]  like for you personally this is for
[02:41:41 -> 02:41:43]  everyone in like the under
[02:41:43 -> 02:41:45]  underworld like the more
[02:41:45 -> 02:41:47]  shady side of society
[02:41:47 -> 02:41:49]  um you know it's
[02:41:49 -> 02:41:51]  often you find this is how you find your commission
[02:41:51 -> 02:41:53]  and such
[02:41:53 -> 02:41:55]  um and there's
[02:41:55 -> 02:41:57]  a new commission it's an open
[02:41:57 -> 02:41:59]  to whoever
[02:41:59 -> 02:42:01]  um it's
[02:42:01 -> 02:42:03]  an open commission which means it's like
[02:42:03 -> 02:42:05]  whoever can
[02:42:05 -> 02:42:07]  retrieve uh whatever
[02:42:07 -> 02:42:09]  has been asked for will
[02:42:09 -> 02:42:11]  be the first it's like it's not it's
[02:42:11 -> 02:42:13]  whoever completes it first will get paid
[02:42:13 -> 02:42:15]  it's a quest
[02:42:15 -> 02:42:17]  board
[02:42:17 -> 02:42:19]  well yeah but it's like more subtle
[02:42:19 -> 02:42:21]  than that um but
[02:42:21 -> 02:42:23]  um you notice
[02:42:23 -> 02:42:25]  um the first thing
[02:42:25 -> 02:42:27]  on this request is you notice
[02:42:27 -> 02:42:29]  this stylized
[02:42:29 -> 02:42:31]  black swan
[02:42:31 -> 02:42:33]  um
[02:42:33 -> 02:42:35]  these are requests
[02:42:35 -> 02:42:37]  from an infamous figure called the
[02:42:37 -> 02:42:39]  black swan um
[02:42:39 -> 02:42:41]  there they've been
[02:42:41 -> 02:42:43]  showing up for the last few years
[02:42:43 -> 02:42:45]  infrequently there
[02:42:45 -> 02:42:47]  tends to be dangerous but
[02:42:47 -> 02:42:49]  extremely well paid
[02:42:49 -> 02:42:51]  um
[02:42:51 -> 02:42:55]  they they attract a lot of attention
[02:42:55 -> 02:42:57]  wow um
[02:42:57 -> 02:42:59]  and wait what attracts a lot of
[02:42:59 -> 02:43:01]  attention these requests everyone
[02:43:01 -> 02:43:03]  requests everybody everyone wants to
[02:43:03 -> 02:43:05]  do that it is
[02:43:05 -> 02:43:07]  like it is very well paid
[02:43:07 -> 02:43:09]  no one knows who the black swan is
[02:43:09 -> 02:43:11]  right only that
[02:43:11 -> 02:43:13]  every few months or so
[02:43:13 -> 02:43:15]  a request appears
[02:43:15 -> 02:43:17]  um tends to be on more on the
[02:43:17 -> 02:43:19]  complicated side tends to be more expensive
[02:43:19 -> 02:43:21]  um
[02:43:21 -> 02:43:23]  mercenaries fight for it
[02:43:23 -> 02:43:25]  this particular request
[02:43:25 -> 02:43:27]  um
[02:43:27 -> 02:43:29]  is asking for
[02:43:29 -> 02:43:31]  the head
[02:43:31 -> 02:43:33]  of
[02:43:33 -> 02:43:35]  the leader
[02:43:35 -> 02:43:37]  of the stone
